Participating in Token House governance can require a serious time commitment. For this reason, people are able to delegate their OP to community members who have explicitly volunteered to play an active role in Token House governance.

Being a delegate is an important job that comes with a lot of responsibility. Therefore, before deciding to become a delegate, you should be familiar with:

- The [[Working Constitution]]
- The [[OPerating Manual]]
- The [[Code of Conduct]]

# Ready to be a delegate?

This is the process to become a delegate:

### Step 1: Commit

- Read the delegate responsibilities on the [forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235) and make sure you understand the responsibilities.

### Step 2: Set up your profile

- Register to be a delegate on the [Optimism Governance Portal (Optimism Agora)](https://vote.optimism.io/) following the [delegate commitment form](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-commitments/235).
- It is not required, but you probably also want to [delegate your OP tokens' voting power to yourself](https://vote.optimism.io/). Please note self-delegation of growth experiments grants is a violation of the [[Collective Grant Policies]].
