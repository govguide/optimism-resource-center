Hello delegates! As always, there is a lot going on in Optimism governance so we‚Äôve put together this short summary to keep you up to date.

### Intents and Collective Values

We hosted a series of community workshops to align on Intents and Values.

- The Token House collectively aligned on Intent¬†#3:¬†Improve the Consumer Experience. You can see the final Intents for Season 5¬†[[Collective Intents - Season 5|here]].
- The Citizens‚Äô House, with Token House input, has drafted¬†[Collective Values.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-values-request-for-token-house-feedback/6985)¬†Delegates and Citizens will be asked to attest to these values before the first joint house vote in January

### Special Voting Cycle¬†``#16a``¬†has concluded!

The following proposals have passed:

- [[Security Council Vote 1 - Change to Security Model|Security Council: Vote #1 - Change to Security Model]]
- [[Developer Advisory Board|Developer Advisory Board Budget]]
- [[Developer Advisory Board|Developer Advisory Board Ratification of Members]]
- [Grants Council Operating Budget Proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-season-5-grants-council-operating-budget/6941)
- [[Code of Conduct Councils|Code of Conduct Council Budget]]
- [[Anticapture Commission]]

The following proposal met quorum but had a majority of ‚ÄòAbstain‚Äô votes, which means no suspension will occur. As a reminder, that was the last time the Token House will be asked to vote on this type of proposal as we implement an alternative method in Season 5.

- [Code of Conduct Violation: Carlos Melgar](https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882)

### What we‚Äôve learned from your feedback

- We‚Äôre excited to welcome an all star slate of members to the [[Developer Advisory Board]]! This Season, the members were appointed by the Foundation. There were some questions as to why board members were not elected. Councils have elected membership as delegates are directly delegating decision making authority to Council members. The board was appointed as they don‚Äôt have direct decision making ability and instead serve in an advisory only capacity. However, it is possible we move to elections for the board in the future.
- There were some great questions about the¬†[Anticapture commission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IHpYB4wcNpDD-a4Dol5tiz3ajhZEMe6o8Ql2yCIq2Yc/edit), which are addressed¬†[here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/anticapture-commission/6889/31).
- We‚Äôve heard your feedback on the need to improve the process and reduce the overhead related to enforcing of the Code of Conduct. The Foundation will work with the elected [[Code of Conduct Councils|Code of Conduct Council]]¬†to rescope and redefine how the Code of Conduct is enforced. Any changes will be ratified by the Token House at the start of Season 5.
- Delegates provided invaluable feedback on proposals. This feedback is critical to inform and iterate on design. However, we need to receive this feedback earlier in the process, as we can‚Äôt easily address concerns or make changes to a proposal once we have moved into a voting period.
- This cycle we noticed a pattern of delegates expressing concerns about a proposal but still voting to approve it. While ideally feedback is provided early enough in the review period to be addressed before the voting period begins, if delegates don‚Äôt fully support a proposal, they should considering voting ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù This provides valuable feedback to the Foundation and allows designs to be reconsidered and concerns to be addressed in subsequent iterations of a proposal. It‚Äôs great to see delegate alignment with governance minimization. Please continue to hold the Foundation accountable to this principle with your votes.
