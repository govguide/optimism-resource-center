## Internal Procedures - Governing

The internal procedures in this document govern the activities of the Experiments and Builders Sub-Committees. The document sets forth the processes the Sub-Committees will follow in order to screen applications and conduct a formal review of proposals submitted for grants.

## Cycle Procedure

Each Cycle will have three periods, a **Submission Period,** a **Review Period**, and a **Decision Period**.

- The Submission Period is designed to accommodate the submission and fair review of applications.
    
- The Review Period is designed to enable a methodical and interactive review of submissions and to enable sound grants decisions.
    
- The Decision Period is designed to facilitate efficient and diligent grants decisions.
    

The Cycle Procedure is set forth in detail in the sections that follow.

### Submission Period - Procedure

- During the Submission Period, applicants will be able to submit proposals through the [Proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals) form.
    

- The Submission Period will last two weeks for each Cycle in Season 4. You can check the date in the [Calendar](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-16376768195478353).
    

- During the Submission Period, the Council will have two objectives: (1) finalize Sub-Committee review rubrics and (2) begin reviewing applications.
    
    - **Objective 1 - Finalize Sub-Committee Review Rubrics**
        
        - The Sub-Committees have published final review rubrics on their respective landing pages.
            
        - For subsequent Cycles, the Sub-Committees will publish any amendments to their review rubrics by the end of the first week of the Submission Period of the Cycle.
            
    - **Objective 2 - Begin Reviewing Applications**
        
        - Sub-Committee members will begin reviewing applications in accordance with the procedures for the Intake Filter outlined below.
            

### Review Period - Procedure

- The Review Period will last for the first three weeks, culminating with the publication of a list of proposals to be voted on by the Council for Final Review.
    
- The Review Period has three objectives: (1) Complete the Intake Filter; (2) Complete Preliminary Review; (3) Publish the list of proposals to be reviewed for Final Review.
    
- **Objective 1 - Intake Filter**
    
    - Intake Filter is a preliminary review to assess the adequacy of proposals. This process runs concurrently with the Submissions Period. It may be extended for up to five days by Sub-Committee vote based on the volume of proposals.
        
    - To begin the Intake Filter process, the Grants Council Operations Lead will assign proposals submitted prior to the end of the Submission Period to Sub-Committee members in sequential order. Applications will be reviewed in order of the time of submission (first to last).
        
    - The assigned member will conduct a Submissions Period Review, as described below.
        
        - For each assigned proposal, the member will review the proposal to assign a score of “0” or “1”.
            
            - A score of “0” means **reject**. The score indicates that a proposal fails to provide key information, does not satisfy proposal template requirements, or otherwise exhibits a deficiency that requires resubmission or rejection.
                
            - A score of “1” means **review**. The score indicates that the proposal satisfies the information requirements of the proposal form and has a reasonable chance to receive a grant, provided that there are clarifications or greater proof of concept.
                
        - For any proposal that is marked “0,” the reviewer must specify the grounds for rejection. The reviewer can tag the application as:
            
            - **Incomplete**: the application is incomplete or does not provide sufficient information to key questions.
                
            - **Deficient-Clarify**: the application does not provide answers sufficient for the reviewer to assess whether to include the application in the Cycle’s Review Period.
                
            - **Deficient-Reject**: the application does not provide answers sufficient to assess whether to include the application in the list of proposals that will be reviewed in the current Cycle’s Review Period and based on the information in the application, it is unlikely the project would successfully receive a grant.
                
            - **Other**: the application is unlikely to receive a grant for another reason that includes a reasonable explanation from the reviewer.
                
    - Reviewers must provide commentary that elaborates on the grounds for rejection. For instance, if an application is Incomplete, the reviewer must specify where the application is incomplete. Reviewers should provide commentary on how a proposal may be improved.
        
    - The Council Lead will approve a simple form for Sub-Committee members to complete for each review and manage a tracker to ensure orderly review of proposals. The form responses will be made available to the community. The Council should target publication within three days after the end of each Cycle.
        
    - Proposers whose applications are rejected on the grounds of Deficient-Clarify or Other may be encouraged to work with Token House delegates to refine the proposal for submission in the following Cycle.
        
- **Objective 2 - Preliminary Review**
    
    - Upon the completion of the Intake Filter, but no later than the end of the first week of the Review Period, the Grants Lead will communicate to each Sub-Committee the number of applications that passed the Intake Review. The Grants Lead will also include an assignment of each proposal to a reviewer.
        
    - **Review Criteria and Proposer Communications**
        
        - A reviewer will complete an assessment form for each proposal they review. The Grants Council lead will provide the form to the Sub-Committee members. The form will be based on each Sub-Committee’s rubric, which can be found in each Sub-Committee landing page:
            

- **Cut-off Scores**
    
    - For Cycle 13, two reviewers will review each proposal that passes intake. If the average of the reviewers' scores is equal to or greater than 20, the proposal will be placed on the Review List for a final review during the Decision Period.
        

### Decision Period - Procedure

- During the Decision Period, the Sub-Committees will deliberate on proposals and decide which proposals to approve for grants. During the Deliberation Week, Sub-Committee members have two objectives: (1) rank proposals and (2) decide final grants list.
    
- **Objective 1 - Proposal Ranking**
    
    - For the first week of the Decision Period, each Sub-Committee member will review each proposal application on the Review List and assign their own score based on the rubric factors.
        
    - The Grants Council Lead will send a summary of the Sub-Committee reviewers’ scores, including an average score for each project prior to the second week of the Decision Period. The average score calculation will be made available to the community along with the publication of grant decisions.
        
- **Objective 2 - Decide Final Grants List**
    
    - At the beginning of the second week of the Decision Period, Sub-Committee members will convene to discuss the overall rankings of the proposals.
        
    - The Sub-Committees will determine the final grantees by selecting the proposals with the highest mean score from the Proposal Ranking in descending order. The Sub-Committees will determine the cutoff, or “n”, number of projects that will receive grants from the descending list, where 1-n shall be grant recipients.
        
    - Each Sub-Committee will collaborate on final grant communications to be made to the grantees and to the Optimism community.
        

### Final Grant Communications

Based on the input of the Sub-Committees, the Communications Lead will communicate the results to the proposers and post the results to the Governance Forum within three days of the end of the Cycle. The Grants Council will update the grants tracker and populate a public portal for tracking milestones for successful grants.

### Grant Recipients

The Grants Council decisions on final grants represent only the opinion of the Grants Council as to which projects are grantworthy. The Grants Council does not issue or distribute grants. The Foundation issues and distributes grants and may deny grants for any reason, including failure to pass KYC. The Grants Council does not endorse or promote and products or projects.

By proceeding with the grant process, any proposer and / or grantee acknowledge that the Grants Council and its reviewers and administrators and their affiliates do not distribute the grants and are not liable to the grant recipients in any way and will hold the Council harmless for any claim related to the grant in any way. The recipients acknowledge that the Grants Council, its reviewers, and its administrators and their affiliates are not making a representation of the effectiveness or quality of their product by giving a grant. The grant is subject to delivery or restriction based on the Optimism Foundation's rules and may be revoked or withheld by the Optimism ecosystem at large, including but not limited to a vote of the Token House for nonperformance of critical milestones, egregious behavior, or any other reason.

## Milestone Completion and Accountability Review

Milestone tracking will follow the structure set forth in the [Milestone Assessments](https://gov.optimism.io/t/milestone-assessment/5314) post on the Governance Forum.

On a bi-weekly basis, the Council will consider the milestone progress submitted by grantees. The Council will assess whether, in its view, the grantee has achieved the critical milestones in sufficient time and communicate its findings to the Foundation and on the Governance Forum as a comment to the proposer's original proposal. The Council may consider compelling reasons for late completion of milestones or grant use changes; however, the Council may not (1) consider Experiments critical milestone changes beyond the later of (a) six months from the date of grant distribution or (b) the latest date of the originally approved critical milestones or (2) Builders critical milestone changes that extend beyond twelve months of the publishing of the relevant grant cycle results. The guidance in this section yields to any contrary rule, guidance, or vote from Token House or the Foundation.

## Official Record and Rule Changes

- The Council will aim to maintain and publish a tracker of votes conducted during Season 4.
    
- The Council will maintain a tracker of grants considered, grants made, milestones for grants, and the progress / completion of milestones.
    
- For Season 4, the operating procedures for Requests for Grants will be governed by the rules set forth in the Requests for Grants page, linked here:
    

- On a bi-weekly basis, the Council may review the effectiveness of its internal procedures and make proposals for improvement. The Sub-Committee can amend the internal procedures by a simple majority vote of the members of both Sub-Committees (provided that any vote to amend the rubric comports with the procedures described above). Any amendment must be published in the Governance Forum. It is recommended that the Sub-Committee defer the effectiveness of an amendment until the next review cycle, unless the amendment creates a critical improvement to the review process.
    

## Rules of Decision

- If one or more Sub-Committee members abstains from a vote, a vote will pass by the simple majority vote of the remaining members, provided there are more than one voting members remaining. If only one member of a Sub-Committee votes, the result will be to take no action on the proposed matter. For instance, if the matter being voted on relates to whether or not to include an application in the final review, the result will be not to include the application in the final review.
    
- Any Council-wide votes must include members of each Sub-Committee to achieve a quorum.
    
- The Grants Council Lead may correct any clear errors in the Internal Procedures or resolve any conflicting provisions. For resolving conflicts, the Lead may submit a question of the best resolution to a vote of the Sub-Committee members, the results of which may be recorded in ``#grants-council`` and on the Governance Forum.
