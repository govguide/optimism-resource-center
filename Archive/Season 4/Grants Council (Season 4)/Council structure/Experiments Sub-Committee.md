## Mission and Membership

The mission of the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee is to maximize the number of users interacting with novel applications on Optimism. The members of the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee for Season 4 are:

- [Michael Vander Meiden](https://gov.optimism.io/u/michael/summary)
    
- [Katie Garcia](https://gov.optimism.io/u/katie/summary)
    
- [GFX Labs](https://gov.optimism.io/u/gfxlabs/summary)
    
- [Matt Losquadro](https://gov.optimism.io/u/mattl/summary)
    
- [Doug Sugma](https://gov.optimism.io/u/moneymandoug/summary)
    

## Sub-Committee Authorization

The following summarizes the basic budget and parameters of the Sub-Committee, as provided for by [Token House vote](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d).

- **Budget**: 2M OP for Season 4
    
- **Grant Size**: <150k OP; 250k maximum with full Council vote 5/8.
    
- **Support**: Successful grants require 3/5 Sub-Committee members to vote in favor at a final vote
    
- **Use**: Grantees should pass OP grants directly to users for engaging with a protocol, platform, product, or service
    
- **Milestones**: 40% of the grant will be distributed upfront for use as described in the proposers distribution plan and consistent with the constraints that apply to Experiments grants; 60% will be distributed upon the completion of certain milestones over a 3-6 month period from the initial grant also consistent with the constraints that apply to Experiments grants.
    
- **Form of grant**: proposers who receive grants will receive grants based on milestones. 40% of the grant will be distributed to the proposer upfront and the remaining 60% will be distributed upon completion of a mid-way point milestone
    
- **Milestones**: milestones should be achievable within 3-6 months
    

## Rubric for Proposals

**Review Rubric**

The Rubric for grading initial proposals should be used by Sub-Committee members based on the criteria in the table below. To pass from Preliminary Review to the Final Review, a proposer much achieve an average score of 20 or higher from the two preliminary reviewers.

|**_Score_**|**0**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Reach**|Reaches a low or insignificant number of OP users|Reaches a moderate number of OP users|Reaches a large number of prospective OP users|Reaches an expansive set of prospective OP users|Reaches an expansive set of prospective OP users who are likely to use Optimism over other networks||
|**Users**|Likely to reach only mercenary users/speculators|Likely to reach users who derive utility from engaging with the Optimism network|Likely to reach users who have a sustained need to use OP|Likely to reach users who have a significant need to use OP and who offer significant value to the OP ecosystem|Likely to reach power users, key Web3 ecosystems, and core developers who have a need to use OP||

Not novel.|Project experiments with existing tech or infrastructure but has novel applications|The project is novel in its use of technology or infrastructure|The project tests the limits of Web3 technology and offers promising new technology or infrastructure||
|**Tangible Use Case for Web3 Technology**|This project is highly abstract or not useful for the adoption of Web3 technology generally or Optimism specifically|This project may have some tangible use case, but it is uncertain whether it will be truly useful or lead to broad Web3 adoption|This project has a reasonable probability of creating a tangible use case, but it is not yet discernable how useful the project will be for broad Web3 adoption|This project presents a clear and useful use case for the adoption of Web3 technology that may exist on the OP Stack, but not necessarily exclusively|This project presents a clear and useful use case for the adoption of Web3 technology on the OP Stack|This project presents a critical stepping stone for the broad adoption of Web3 technology built on the OP Stack|

|**Distribution implementation plan**|The proposed plan has little likelihood of reaching the intended recipients|The proposed plan is unlikely to reach the breadth of recipients intended|The proposed plan is reasonably tailored to reach the breadth of recipients intended|The proposed plan creates a likelihood that the grant will reach the breadth of the recipients' intended|The proposed plan is well-designed to reach the breadth of recipients' intended||
|**Grant size**|Grant size significantly outweighs the projected benefit|Grant size is considerably larger than expected benefit OR if grant Size is greater than 100k OP, this is the highest score possible for this category|Grant size is proportional to expected benefit OR Grant Size is greater than 65k OP, this is the highest score possible for this category|The expected benefit outweighs the grant size|Expected benefit meaningfully exceeds grant size||
|**Team assessment**|The team does not substantiate the ability to deliver on the plan|The team does not show significant ability to deliver on the plan|The team shows a reasonable ability to deliver on the plan|The team shows a significant ability to deliver on the plan|The team exceeds what is required to deliver on the plan||

|_*Reviewers will have a discretionary score to apply to the overall rubric of (-2 to 2). An explanation must be included with the assignment of any discretionary score._|||||||

## Restrictions

- It is not the goal of the Growth Experiments Sub-Committee to create retroactive airdrops
    
- The **No Sale rule** applies as follows:
    
    “**OP received through Growth Experiments Grants should not be sold by the grant recipient.** This “no sale” rule:
    
    - _Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates, and any other related persons._ These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.
        
    - _Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly or privately._ Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.
        
    - _Does not include using OP to incentivize usage_. Providing OP as liquidity mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.
        
    - _There is no expiration to this rule for Growth Experiments Grants”_
        
    - [Refer here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-proposal-template/3233) for the text of the rule.
