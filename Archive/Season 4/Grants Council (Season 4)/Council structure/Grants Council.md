The Optimism Grants Council was initiated in Governance Season 3. This page outlines the basic details of the Grants Council as constituted for Season 4.

## Purpose

The Grants Council serves by delegation from Token House. The Grants Council exists to:

- create a more streamlined and consistent process for proposers
    
- set a pace for grant distributions
    
- define a clear scope, with clear differentiation from Partner Fund
    
- create accountability via smaller grant sizes and milestone-based distributions
    
- reduce the workload on delegates so that they have more time to weigh in on high-impact votes, better positioning the grants process within the broader responsibilities of Token House governance
    

## Structure

The Grants Council consists of two Sub-Committees: Builders and Growth Experiments. Each Sub-Committee has a mandate to fulfill the purpose of the [[Governance Fund Charter]].

The [[Builders Sub-Committee]] aims to maximize the number of builders (developers and visionaries) building novel applications on Optimism.

The [[Experiments Sub-Committee|Growth Experimentation Sub-Committee]] aims to maximize the number of users interacting with novel applications on Optimism.

Three new roles have been added to the Grants Council structure for Season 4. These positions are held by elected reviewers and have been appointed by the Grants Council lead.

- **Communications Lead:** handles the communications of the Grants Council with the Optimism community. Responsible for communicating calendar items, key updates, Cycle results, and other important items to keep the community informed about the Grants Council's process.
    
    - [Katie Garcia](https://gov.optimism.io/u/katie/summary)
        
    
- **Operations Lead:** manages the infrastructure (including infrastructural decisions) of the Grants Council, responsible for maintaining orderly operation of the proposal and review process. Keeps Grants Council record.
    
    - [Gonna.eth](https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/summary)
        
    
- **RFG Lead**: initiates requests for grant (RFG) ideas in collaboration with the Optimism community. The RFG manager is tasked with discovering the broad needs of the Optimism community and creating task-specific grants to satisfy those needs. The RFG manager submits RFG ideas to the Council for approval, which are then published to the community.

## Season 4

The Grants Council will run for three Cycles in Season 4: Cycle 13, Cycle 14, and Cycle 15. The Grants Council itself is an experiment in governance. At the end of Season 4, the Grants Council may be reviewed by Token House to determine if the Council is an improvement to the grants process that should be retained.
