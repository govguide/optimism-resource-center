## Mission and Membership

The mission of the Builders Sub-Committee is to **maximize the number of builders** (developers and visionaries) **building** **novel applications** **on Optimism**. The members of the Builders Sub-Committee for Season 4 are:

- [Gonna.eth](https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth/summary)
    
- [Kaereste](https://gov.optimism.io/u/kaereste/summary)
    
- [Jack Anorak](https://gov.optimism.io/u/jackanorak/summary)
    

## Sub-Committee Authorization

The following summarizes the basic budget and parameters of the Sub-Committee, as provided for by the [Token House vote](https://snapshot.org/#/opcollective.eth/proposal/0x37fc8a6ae60cff2e4e72fe9c0567f739bb9a78262c2ada236892fcbc7af2c32d).

- **Budget**: 1MM OP across all grants for Season 4
    
- **Grant Size**: <50k OP per grant
    
- **Grant Lockup**: 1 year ([see explainer here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grant-token-lock-explainer/5060))
    
- **Support**: Successful grants require 2/3 Sub-Committee members to adopt a proposal or approve an action
    

## Rubric for Proposals

**Review Rubric**

The Rubric for grading initial proposals should be used by Sub-Committee members based on the criteria in the table below. To pass from Preliminary Review to the Final Review, a proposer much achieve an average score of 20 or higher from the two preliminary reviewers.

|**Builder Reach**|**0**|**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Builder draw|Project unlikely to draw more builders to Optimism|Project likely to draw more builders to Optimism|The project likely to draw many builders to Optimism|The project is likely to draw many builders to Optimism who focus on building novel products|The project is likely to draw a large number of builders who focus on building novel products|
|Development of OP Stack|The project will lead to the deployment of very few smart contracts on Optimism|The project will lead to the deployment of a small number of smart contracts on Optimism|The project will lead to the deployment of a moderate number of smart contracts on Optimism|The project will lead to the deployment of many smart contracts on Optimism|The project will lead to the deployment of a very large (scalable) number of smart contracts on Optimism|
|**Merits**|**0**|**1**|**2**|**_3_**|**_4_**|
|Builder commitment|No commitment attraction|Mercenary commitment attraction (stays until benefits end)|Commitment attraction (1 â€“ 3 months after rewards end)|Commitment attraction (1 year after rewards end)|Commitment attraction (2+ years after rewards end)|
|Likelihood of success|There's a clear flaw in the design that cannot be easily remedied|Difficult to see the project continuing for more than a year|There's a reasonable chance that the project has intermediate-to-long-term success (+1 Year)|The project is likely to generate long-term, sustainable value for the Optimism ecosystem|The project has a substantial likelihood of generating long-term, sustainable value for the Optimism ecosystem|
|Novelty|There is little to distinguish this project from other projects that exist on Optimism already|This is one of a small number of examples of a project being built on Optimism that is otherwise common throughout Web3|This project is distinguishable from other projects in Web3 on the margins (e.g., a different way of doing something that may be done in other contexts already)|This project is distinguishable from other projects in Web3: very few other projects are doing something similar and this is not merely a different way of performing an existing operation|This project is on the horizon and is meaningfully different from other projects in Web3.|
|Grant size|Grant size significantly outweighs the projected benefit|Grant size is considerably larger than the expected benefit|Grant size is proportional to expected benefit OR if Grant Size is greater than 35K OP, this is the highest score possible for this category|Expected benefit outweighs the grant size|Expected benefit meaningfully exceeds grant size|
|Team assessment|The team does not substantiate the ability to deliver on the plan|The team does not show significant ability to deliver on the plan|The team shows a reasonable ability to deliver on the plan|The team shows a significant ability to deliver on the plan|The team exceeds what is required to deliver on the plan|
|**Milestones**|0|1|2|||
|Milestone trackability|Not trackable|Somewhat trackable|Easily trackable|||
|Milestone orientation|Not oriented toward bringing more builders to Optimism|Oriented towards bringing more builders to Optimism|Oriented toward more builders and toward making project composable with Optimism ecosystem|||
|**Alignment**|0|1|2|3|4|
|Optimism relationship|Not deployed on Optimism and no indication (beyond grant application) of an intent to deploy on Optimism|Not deployed on Optimism, but has given a reasonable indication of an intention to deploy on Optimism|Deployed on Optimism and focused on Optimism|||
|Open-sourcing|Not open-source|Currently or initially open-source, but not committed to an open-source model|Committed to a long-term open-source model|||
|The demo is included (binary yes/no)|No demo or poor demo included|High-quality demo included||||
|**Other**|-2|-1|0|1|2|
|Timely Submission||Proposal submitted in last 48 hours of Submission Period|Proposal submitted in the second week of the Submission Period|Proposal submitted in the first week of the Submission Period||
|Discretionary Factors*||||||
|_*Reviewers will have a discretionary score to apply to the overall rubric of (-2 to 2). An explanation must be included with the assignment of any discretionary score._||||||

## Co-Grants

- Builders projects seeking up-front grant capital can request to participate in Optimism x Syndicate co-grants by indicating the need on the Cycle 13 proposal form.
    
- The Builders Sub-Committee can agree or disagree with the need for a co-grant. Projects determined by the Builders Sub-Committee to be eligible for an upfront grant may be distributed pro-rata grants from the Optimism x Syndicate co-grant contract. Funds from the co-granting pool need eligible recipients of grants.
    
- The Grants Council is not responsible for maintaining or distributing co-grants.

## Advice for Proposers

- Grants are for _projects,_ not necessarily _protocols._
    
    - For example, Protocol X, which offers an entire suite of DeFi products, wants to deploy an innovative lending platform on Optimism. This deployment is the thing that would be receiving a grant. When Protocol X submits a proposal, they should be focusing on what sort of effect the deployment of that lending platform would have on Optimism.
        
    - Meanwhile, Project Y is simply a lone developer who has built NFT Oracle tooling. This tooling (which is the entire project) would be the thing that is presented for a grant.
        
- Be specific in demonstrating the need for and benefits of this project. It's not enough to say "This project will increase the number of builders": describe which builders would be drawn by this initiative, why they haven't been able to do something on Optimism, and what this initiative would unlock for them.
    
- Account for the grant asks and match it to the anticipated benefit as much as you can. Explain what exactly the grant is funding, and what overall anticipated benefit this grant will achieve.
