## Key Processes and Dates

Season 4 will run for fifteen weeks, beginning on June 8, 2023, and concluding on September 20, 2023. The Season will include two grants cycles:

- **Cycle 13**: June 8th - July 12th
    
- **Cycle 14**: July 13th - August 16th
    
- **Cycle 15**: August 17th - September 20th
    

During both Cycles, there will be three periods, a **Submission Period,** a **Review Period**, and a **Decision Period**. The Submission Period will run for two weeks from the beginning of the Cycle. During the Submission Period, the proposals may submit proposals on the [Proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals) page.

The deadline for each Submission Period will be [19:00 GMT](https://greenwichmeantime.com/time-gadgets/time-zone-converter/) on the calendar date specified. For Season 4, the Submission Period deadlines will be as follows:

- **Submission Period 1**: June 22nd
    
- **Submission Period 2**: July 27th
    
- **Submission Period 3**: August 31st
    

Any proposal made after the deadline will be considered for the next Cycle. Proposal dates will be measured from the time of submission rather than from the time of posting to the [Proposals](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/proposals) page.

The Review Period runs for the first three weeks of the Cycle and is concurrent with the Submissions Period for the first two weeks. During the Review Period, Sub-Committee members will conduct an intake review of all applications and a deeper review of proposals that pass intake. During this period, Sub-Committee members may communicate with proposers to seek clarifications and refine milestones. At the end of a Review Period, each Sub-Committee must post a list of proposals that are being reviewed (**Grant Review Roundup**). The Grant Review Roundup for each Cycle of Season 4 is due on:

- **Cycle 13**: June 29th
    
- **Cycle 14**: August 3rd
    
- **Cycle 15**: September 7th
    

The Decision Period will run for the last two weeks of each Cycle. During the Decision Period, the Grants Council will rank proposals and reach final decisions as to which grants to award. Members of the Sub-Committees may contact proposers about refinements to milestones or the grant amount requested. Grant decisions will be published no later than three days after the conclusion of each Cycle. The Final Grants Decisions deadlines for Season 4 are:

- **Cycle 13 Final Grant Decisions Roundup**: July 15th, 2023 (3 days after the end of Cycle 13)
    
- **Cycle 14 Final Grant Decisions Roundup**: August 19th, 2023 (3 days after the end of Cycle 14)
    
- **Cycle 15 Final Grant Decisions Roundup**: September 23rd, 2023 (3 days after Cycle 15)
