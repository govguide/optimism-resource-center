### 6. Complete the template. From Draft to Discussion

Scrolling down you should see the template you need to complete. Complete the template and if you need more time click Create at the bottom. The proposals always start in "Draft" status.

- **DRAFT** **means no one else can see your proposal**
    

Once you are set you can change your proposal status to "Discussion" on the top right corner. The proposal will go public and everyone will be able to comment. Reviewers will leave their comments there and you will be able to change any important feedback you might consider.
