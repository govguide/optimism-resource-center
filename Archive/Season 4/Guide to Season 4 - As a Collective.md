Weâ€™d like to start by recognizing the incredible contributions of our delegates in Season 3:

- [Retroactive Delegate Rewards Season 3](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retroactive-delegate-rewards-season-3/5871/2):Â _Retroactive rewards in recognition of the important contributions of top active delegates over the past Season._

In Season 4, weâ€™ll lay the groundwork to align the entire community around [[(OLD) Collective Intents (Season 4)|Collective Intents]] and several other foundational concepts upon which the Collective will be built.

### **Introducing: Intents**

[[(OLD) Collective Intents (Season 4)|Intents]] are directional goals that allow the Collective to align and focus. **All work supported or executed by the Collective should be in pursuit of our Collective Intents.**

You can think of an Intent as a near term target. Each Intent will be equipped with its own budget for Season 4.

### **Introducing: Missions**

**Token House [[Token House Missions|Missions]]Â are proposals for specific initiatives that achieve an Intent.**Â You can think of a Mission as an arrow aiming at the target (Intent). Just as there are many paths an arrow might take on its way to the target, there are many different Missions that might accomplish an Intent. Missions are specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish in a given timeframe.

#### There are two types of Missions:

> - **[[Proposed Mission Template|Proposed Missions]]** must be submitted under an Intent. Each Intent will be equipped with its own budget. The Token House will then rank order Proposed Missions until the budget for each Intent is fully allocated. Proposed Missions enable the Governance Fund to support a broader range of initiatives aligned with our Intents.
> - **[Foundation Missions](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1)**Â are Missions that are defined by the Foundation and are akin to public Requests for Proposals for the Partner Fund. Foundation Missions must also work towards our Intents.

### **Introducing: Alliances**

Missions are executed by [[Season 4 Alliance Guide|Alliances]], or groups of contributors thatÂ _temporarily_Â work together to accomplish a Mission start-to-finish.

Alliances can submit proposals based on [[Collective Trust Tiers]], the very first step towards a more robust reputation system based on positive impact within the ecosystem.Â [Attestations](https://attestationstation.xyz/)Â will also be introduced in Season 4, allowing reputation to start accumulating on-chain.

### **How it all Comes Together**

![[How it comes together.png]]

Season 4 is ambitious as it introduces many of the foundational concepts behind the [[The Optimistic Vision|Optimistic Vision]].Â [[(OLD) Collective Intents (Season 4)|Collective Intents]] are the first step in aligning the Token House and Citizensâ€™ House in pursuit of our strategic goals. [[Token House Missions|Missions]]Â enable the Token House to support work aligned with these Intents and to start bootstrapping a market for RetroPGF. [[Collective Trust Tiers]]Â hint at a future in which oneâ€™s positive impact in the ecosystem creates additional opportunity.

Finally, in Season 4, the Foundation will take several steps towards increased transparency and further decentralization by voting on two additional proposal types for the first time: Treasury Appropriations (Foundation budget approval) and Inflation Adjustment.

In designing the Season 4 structure, weâ€™ve drawn inspiration from governance experiments run at several other DAOs, primarily Gitcoin, ENS, and CabinDAO. As tribute, we will nominate these DAOs in the next round of RetroPGF.Â ðŸ”´âœ¨

**We know this is a lot information to digest. Weâ€™ve scheduled a Foundation AMA to answer any and all of your questions on Season 4.**

You can see the AMA and the entire schedule outlined below on ourÂ [public governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).

# What Does This Mean for Me?

Iâ€™m interested in contributing to the CollectiveIâ€™m a delegate

Please note we are experimenting with new funding structures in Season 4. If these structures continue beyond Season 4, the Intent Budgeting process and Proposed Missions will occur at a frequency that aligns them with RetroPGF rounds. Voting Cycles and Seasons will continue at their regular frequency.
