### Thank you

A huge thank you is due to delegates for their continued dedication to experimentation and iteration. This Season, the Collective aligned around Collective Intents and increased the number of non-core teams building the Collective with the introduction of Missions. The Grants Council, renewed for a second Season, processed an incredible 448 grant applications! Votable supply of OP increased from 40M to 69M and it was the first full Season voting on [Agora](https://vote.optimism.io/)! The Citizens’ House expanded to ~138 badgeholders and will reward 30M OP in [[RetroPGF Round 3|RetroPGF Round 3]].

### Why Retroactive Rewards?

The Optimism Collective rewards delegates retroactively. Retroactive rewards are a core pillar of the large scale experiment to establish a new, regenerative economic system within the Collective. **Retroactive rewards will be the primary contribution reward mechanism in the Collective** and when the Governance Fund runs out of OP (as it is intended to), RetroPGF will need to support all activity in the Collective.

Feedback on retro delegate rewards is extremely helpful in refining what will be the primary reward mechanism in the Collective. Delegates have requested more insight into the actions that are likely to be considered high impact in the upcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are defined. There have also been several discussions about setting expectations for high impact delegate/badgeholders. Please see the **[[Anticapture Commission]]**, a first step towards defining the highest impact delegates and empowering them with additional resources.

Other reasons for maintaining retroactive delegate rewards:

- The amount of participation required will continue to vary dramatically as governance experiments evolve Season over Season. Retroactive rewards are better able to adapt to this level of iteration.
- Rewards that are allocated retroactively are not subject to a lock-up.

Thank you to your continued dedication to this experiment to retroactively reward impact. Being a delegate requires a serious time commitment and the Collective strongly benefits from your engagement.

The below criteria recognizes top delegates in Season 4 (snapshot as of 9/7/23, the start of the last Voting Cycle of the Season, in which there were no votes.)

Delegates that meet the below criteria are eligible to receive a rewards as outlined in the below chart.

- Top 100 delegates by voting power (this has been adjusted from delegates with >0.25%, based on delegate feedback.)
    - Protocols in the Protocol Delegation Program that qualified as top 100 delegates only as a result of Foundation delegations are not eligible for rewards.

|Criteria|Definition|Reasoning|OP|
|---|---|---|---|
|Participated in Season 4|>70% voting participation in Season 4 (abstain votes count towards participation). In Season 4, 3/4 votes were required to meet this threshold.|Voter turnout is critical to the resilience of the governance system|6,000 OP|
|Engaged during the Reflection Period|Voted in Special Voting Cycle ``#12a`` AND ``#12b``|Delegate engagement during Reflection Periods is a crucial part of the feedback process, which enables iterative improvement|3,000 OP|
|Experimented with a new governance process|Provided support for [[Token House Missions]] as identified in this [Token House participation and incentives: an extended analysis](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-participation-and-incentives-an-extended-analysis/6479)|Experimentation is core to Optimism’s approach to governance|1,000 OP|

The Grants Council did an outstanding job this Season, processing many more grants than in previous Seasons. In Season 3, the Foundation provided retroactive rewards to the Grants Council for their outsized impact as the Foundation proposed the Council’s initial budget. Since the Council now proposes its own budget, and Token House Seasons are now aligned with RetroPGF rounds, it is important that the Council’s impact be assessed by the Collective and rewarded via RetroPGF. The Grants Council is encouraged to apply as a project in Round 3, so that the Collective may reward the impact the Grants Council created in Season 4.

*Signifies participant in the Protocol Delegation Program. Only protocols that would have been included in the top 100 delegates even without their delegation through the program were eligible for rewards.

---

**Consistent with other grant allocations, all delegate rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.**

This round of retroactive delegate rewards will be allocated from the “Unallocated” portion of the Ecosystem Fund, not the Governance Fund (and is therefore not subject to Token House approval).

# Retro Governance Reward Framework

Delegates and badgeholders have requested more insight into the actions that may be considered high impact in the upcoming Season, similarly to how RetroPGF Scope and Collective Intents are defined. The highest impact contributions will align with the Collective Intents. The below table outlines activities that are aligned with the Intents, but does not guarantee any retroactive rewards based on the below criteria.

|Intent|Aligned activities|
|---|---|
|Progress Towards Technical Decentralization|Being a member of the Developer Advisory Board, substantive engagement on proposals related to Superchain governance, sharing of technical knowledge or analysis with the broader community, etc.|
|Grow the Superchain|Being a member of the Grants Council, actively supporting the onboarding of new OP Chains or projects, providing approvals on successful Delegate Mission Requests, being a member of the Anticapture Commission, etc.|
|Community Intent (TBD)|To be completed once the community sets Intent #3|
|Improve Governance Accessibility|Enforcing the Code of Conduct, monitoring grant programs, participating in Reflection Periods, voting, creating Lists that are useful to other badgeholders, expanding the Citizens’ House capabilities to assess impact & profit, which could come in the form of useful tooling, education of badgeholders, and/or other initiatives.|
