# Collective Intents

![[image (2).png]]
## Intent 1: Progress towards technical decentralization

The Optimism Collective must continue to make progress on its core value proposition to provide resilient, decentralized, scalable compute.

Last Season, the Bedrock upgrade marked a significant step in modularizing our proof systems, paving a path forward to multiple proof schemes. As a result of the commitment to Bedrock, OP Labs has made steady progress towards a fault proof alpha program on testnet. Besides OP Labs, this has enabled teams at RiscZero and O(1) Labs to take on Foundation Mission Requests targeted at research implementations of zero-knowledge provers for the Collective. Client implementations like op-reth, op-nethermind, and op-erigon continue to make steady progress. Governance is reviewing proposals to implement a Security Council that enacts upgrades for OP Mainnet and the Superchain.

The Collective will continue to prioritize this work in the next Season; this Intent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority.

**Collective Measurements**

- “[Stage](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe)” of technical decentralization
- Client implementation diversity

**How the Governance Fund Supports Intent #1:**  
The Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:

- While this Intent continues to be the Collective’s highest priority, many of the projects that support progress towards technical decentralization require high context and specific expertise.
- This work will be reflected primarily in Foundation Mission Requests and ongoing core development work by community teams like OP Labs, Coinbase, RiscZero and O(1) Labs.
- **Please note, Missions or other grants from the Governance Fund in support of Intent #1 will be subject to review by the [[Developer Advisory Board]], if approved.**

**Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:**

- Research on redundant or decentralized sequencing
- Tooling to enable circumventing a faulty sequencer
- Contributions that increase the availability of technical support
- Auditing services for grant recipients
- Fault detection and security monitoring
- Attestations of onchain smart contracts with github commit information
- Upgrade diffing, validation and transparency of their impacts
- Chain SLA monitoring based on the Law of Chains
- Contributions that increase transparency into revenue share
- Contributions focused on governance security (anti-sybil attacks, etc.)

## Intent 2: Grow the Superchain

Over the past year, Optimism has seen an exciting amount of ecosystem growth across many different verticals and communities, and across both OP Mainnet and OP Chains.

In Season 5, the Collective will focus on developer growth across the Superchain. Crypto is closer than ever to reaching its full potential, and it’s the Collective’s responsibility to create the conditions for developers around the globe to keep working towards a new version of the internet that puts power in the hands of people.

As Optimism expands and the Superchain grows, this Collective Intent is targeted at developer growth across the entire Collective: we care about developers deploying new applications on OP Mainnet; teams or ecosystems adding new OP Chains to the Superchain; and the growth of new and existing OP Chains.

**Collective Measurements**  
Active Builders on the Superchain, defined as:

- Unique contract deployers across all OP Chains
- Unique contract deployers of contracts with interaction from >50 unique addresses

**How the Governance Fund Supports Intent #2:**  
The Governance Fund will support this Intent in a limited capacity:

- The Governance Fund should focus on Mission Requests and/or grants that advance developer growth on OP Mainnet. The Governance Fund should not focus on grants to grow other specific OP Chain ecosystems.
- The Governance Fund may support projects that support developer experience on OP Mainnet and across the Superchain.
- The Governance Fund is a small, finite supply of tokens intended to bootstrap the Collective as it evolves to be supported primarily via retroPGF; RetroPGF, along with other mechanisms, is better suited to support the growth of other individual OP Chain ecosystems.

**Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:**

- Builder and/or growth incentive grants for projects deploying on OP Mainnet
- Interoperability research
- Developer tooling that improves users’ ability to build, test, and deploy applications
- Contributions that improve wallet, block explorer, RPC, or other dev-centric product integrations
- Contributions that support development and adoption of account abstraction wallets
- Frontends to increase access to Optimism’s canonical bridge contracts

## Intent 3: Improve the Consumer Experience

_Intent #3 has been set by Token House delegates, with the help of Simona Pop._

To onboard more users to the Optimism network, we must make it easier to engage with practical use cases. This improvement will be vital in expanding our reach and impact.

**Collective Measurements**

- Number of new wallet addresses with a verified anti-sybil check
- Number of repeat transactions from new addresses
- Number of transactions from new addresses that occur via non-DeFi applications

**How the Governance Fund Supports Intent #3:** Intent #3 will be primarily supported by the Governance Fund.

**Example * Delegate Mission Requests:**

- Development of practical use cases covering areas like gaming, encrypted on-chain data ownership for companies and individuals, digital identity, ZK application infrastructure, social applications, and remittance/transfer infrastructure.
- Experience enhancements that may include fiat on/off ramps, UX improvements (e.g., EIP 6551 and EIP 4337), web2 profile import to web3 profiles, and innovations that streamline on-chain activities.

## Intent 4: Improve governance accessibility

Optimism Governance decides on protocol upgrades, allocates the token treasury, and stewards Collective profit. Optimism’s two-house system is designed to create healthy checks and balances and expand ownership to a diverse set of governance participants. For more on the scope and responsibilities of Optimism’s governance system, see the [[The Future of Optimism Governance|Future of Optimism Governance]].

The Collective must prioritize accessibility in order to create governance structures that welcome a broad range of Optimists to participate. “Accessibility” includes enabling a diversity of perspectives to participate in governance, facilitating better knowledge sharing to develop more informed voters, and lowering barriers to participation for more culturally diverse involvement in the governance process. Increasing the votable supply and reducing the concentration of voting power are important byproducts of improved accessibility.

**Collective Measurements**

- Delegated supply of OP
- Average OP voted per governance proposal

**How the Governance Fund Supports Intent #4:**  
The Governance Fund will support the majority of Mission Requests that advance this Intent.

**Examples of * Delegate Mission Requests:**

- Contributions that educate the broader community about Optimism governance and RetroPGF
- Contributions that increase the resiliency of core governance infrastructure
- User friendly interfaces to interact with governance programs
- Contributions that promote and maintain a welcoming governance community
- Contributions that increase the understandability of the governance system for new entrants
- Contributions that create transparency and accountability for grant recipients and governance participants

*Delegate Mission Requests are approved by the Token House and supported by grants from the Governance Fund. The Foundation also creates Mission Requests under each Intent, which you can view [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues).

# What Does this Mean for Delegates?

During the Reflection Period, delegates will set Intent #3, as described above. Delegates will vote on Intent Budgets, proposed by the elected Grants Council Lead, in Special Voting Cycle `#16b`.
