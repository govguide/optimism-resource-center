Commission Reports should be shared with the Citizens’ House when the Commission believes an imbalance or conflict has arisen in the Token House that needs to be addressed by the Citizens’ House. Most often, this will relate to a vote that the Commission believes the Citizens’ House should consider veto-ing.

### MVP Process

- The Anticapture Commission may file two types of reports:
    - **Statement of Concern**: Early alert to badgeholders about imbalances arising in Token House
    - **Request for Veto:** Request for badgeholders to veto a specific proposal
- Both types of reports must be posted on the forum and Discord (tagging badgeholders)
    - Requests for veto must be posted no later than the start of the voting period for the relevant proposal
- Badgeholders should abstain from voting on a proposal until the next Voting Cycle if they believe further deliberation is needed
- The Foundation will facilitate a deliberation between Houses during the subsequent review period, if needed
