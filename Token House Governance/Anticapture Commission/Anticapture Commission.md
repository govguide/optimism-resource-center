Throughout Season 4, delegates provided feedback attesting to the importance of recognizing the highest impact delegates and creating standards around their expected participation. In Season 5, broadening the set of stakeholders involved in governance will be a focus, with a priority of ensuring that high impact individual delegates remain well represented in the Token House.

Considering both of these factors, Season 5 introduces an Anticapture Commission, comprised of the highest impact delegates. The Anticapture Commission will have a mandate to represent the interests of individual delegates as a key stakeholder group, and to prevent capture of the Token House by any one stakeholder group. If approved by the Token House, the Anticapture Commission would be delegated 10M OP from the Governance Fund in Season 5 and 6. After one year, the Anticapture Commission would need to propose any continuation of the program to Governance.

# Anticapture Commission Charter

## Goals

- Uphold standards of delegate engagement for the highest context, impact, and participation delegates (you can think of the Anticapture Commission as recognized delegates)
- Represent individual delegates as a key stakeholder group by holding office hours each week and escalating community concerns to be put forward as discussion topics or proposals. This should empower individual delegates as we broaden the set of stakeholders involved in governance decision
- Provide alerts to the Citizens’ House when concerns arise over significant imbalances in power between groups of stakeholders (for example, between individual delegates, core dev teams, OP Chains, and various other potential stakeholder groups)

## Commission Structure

The Anticapture Commission would be comprised of high impact delegates (delegates meeting the membership criteria outlined below) and the Council Leads from all other existing Councils. Anticapture Commission votes would be cast based on a simply majority of individual member votes.

## Membership

- Members must be an individual or professional delegate and not a representative of a protocol or corporation
- Council Leads from each existing Council will also be considered Members, even if they do not meet the below criteria, as their role as Lead may prevent them from meeting this criteria but they are some of the highest context delegates. If a Council Lead does not wish to be a member of the Anticapture Commission, they may select a replacement from the Council they lead
- All other members of Councils are eligible to be members of the Anticapture Commission, so long as they meet the below criteria
- Members, as described above, must be in the top 100 delegates **AND**
    - Maintain = > 70% voting participation from time of first vote cast, provided > 3 votes cast. Delegates that cast their first vote in 2022 will be eligible with = > 65% voting participation
    - Have received retro rewards for governance contributions, whether as delegates in any of S1-S4

**Please note: All members will need to KYC to vote as a member of the Anticapture Commission**

Membership will be determined based on the above criteria at the beginning of each Season and will be updated at the mid-point of the Season, based on performance. This periodicity is intended to allow for normal fluctuations in a delegate’s ability to participate while maintaining accountability and limiting operational overhead.

## Member Responsibilities

In exchange for being entrusted with additional voting power, Anticapture Commission members will be expected to:

- Attend an office hours at least once per Voting Cycle (every three weeks) to listen to community feedback and raise concerns to the broader governance community on their behalf
- Provide delegate approvals or a reason for not providing approval on >10% of the proposals requiring approval during the period
    - In Season 4, only delegates with >0.25% voting power could provide delegate approvals on proposal drafts. In Season 5, the top 100 delegates will be able to provide approvals, which will include all members of the Anticapture Commission.
- If a Member does not meet the above expectations, they will not be eligible to be on the Anticapture Commission during the subsequent period
- Members may designate other leadership roles amongst themselves as necessary/desired
- Members will receive group delegation, but not OP rewards, for their participation on the Anticapture Commission. However, meeting the criteria required to be part of the Anticapture Commission may be included in the qualification criteria for [[Retro Delegate Rewards - Season 4|retro delegate rewards]]
- Members must elect a commission lead each Season, by simple majority vote among qualifying members

**The Anticapture Commission Lead should:**

- Qualify to be a member of the Anticapture Commission
- Organize regular commission meetings. It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the community.
- Execute votes from the delegation wallet, according to the outcomes of commission votes (possibly via a commission snapshot space)
- Author, or coordinate authorship, of any reports circulated to the Citizens’ House, according to the process outlined [[Anticapture Commission Reports|here]]. A report must have 4 delegate approvals from commission members to be considered valid.
- Calculate qualifying delegates at the mid-point of the Season and before the start of the next Season, including assessment of whether Members have upheld the Member Responsibities
- Exercise decision-making authority in the event that the commission cannot come to consensus on a matter (ie. serve as tie breaker)
