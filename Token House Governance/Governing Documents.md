[[Working Constitution|The Working Constitution]] outlines governing provisions and principles for the Collective. It will remain in effect no more than four years from the date of its adoption. After that, authority over governance will be ceded to a permanent Bedrock Constitution that incorporates the lessons of the Collective’s prior governance experiments.

The Collective’s [[OPerating Manual]] describes current governance processes for the Token House. It will evolve, with the Collective, over time. The version linked here, from [The Optimism Foundation's github repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual), is the authoritative one.
