## What Does This Mean for Delegates?

Reviewers will be elected via approval voting in Special Voting Cycle ``#16b``. Approval voting is a mechanism that allows each delegate to vote for as many nominees as they choose with equal voting power. The nominees with the highest percentage of approval votes will be elected to the Council. Please note this policy in the [[Code of Conduct]]:

> In the case of approval/ranked choice elections, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.
> 
> _Example: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so long as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open positions on the sub-committee.)_

Please note the above outlined voting mechanism is subject to change depending on Council structure and number of eligible candidates.
