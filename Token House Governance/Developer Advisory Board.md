## Introducing the Developer Advisory Board

Developers are among the Collective’s most important stakeholders as they are building the Optimism protocol and the applications on top of it. Governance of an L2, and growth of its supporting ecosystem, will require governance to make many technical decisions.

For example:

- [[Collective Intents - Season 5|Intent #1]], progress towards technical decentralization, is the highest priority for the Collective. Proposals under this Intent require technical expertise.
    
- Builder grants aim to increase the number of active developers deploying on Optimism. The Grants Council must make decisions that are heavily informed by the developer perspective, particularly at the application level.
    
- The Token House is tasked with evaluating high importance protocol upgrades and enforcing the [[Law of Chains v0.1 - Full Draft|Law of Chains]], both of which require high levels of technical understanding. In future Seasons, the Developer Advisory Board’s mandate may be expanded to assist delegates in assessing technical proposals.
    

Given the need for Optimism governance to make good technical decisions, the Foundation is proposing the establishment of a Developer Advisory Board (DAB) with the below mandate.

## Developer Advisory Board Charter

## Goals

- Assess and approve [[Missions v2 - Season 5|Delegate Mission Request]] drafts based on their technical merits
- Aid the Grants Council in assessing approved [[Missions v2 - Season 5|Delegate Mission Requests and Mission Applications]] under [[Collective Intents - Season 5#Intent 1 Progress towards technical decentralization|Intent #1]]
- Advise the Grants Council in assessing the completion of technical milestones

## Advisory Board Structure

This Advisory Board is not a Council as they will serve in an advisory capacity without official decision making authority. Therefore, they will not be elected as representatives, but will rather be appointed. The initial set of members will be appointed by the Foundation. In subsequent Seasons, members will be appointed by the Grants Council.

The Developer Advisory Board will not vote on proposals. However, the advisory board’s approval will be required on all Delegate Mission Requests under Intent #1. In order to provide approvals, a simple majority of advisory board members must agree that an approval has technical merit. Evaluation criteria and rubrics should be made public, when applicable. The Grants Council should also consider the Developer Advisory Board’s input on all Mission Applications under Intent #1.

## Membership

The initial Developer Advisory Board will be comprised of six members and a lead, one of which will be a non-voting member of the OP Labs engineering or product team. One member of the Developer Advisory Board will be designated as the Lead to manage general coordination and operations. The Lead will be a non-voting member. If approved, the Foundation will appoint the below members:

- Board Lead: [Brock](https://twitter.com/brockjelmore)
- Board Member: [Philogy](https://twitter.com/real_philogy)
- Board Member (forfeiting compensation): [Noah](https://twitter.com/NoahCitron)
- Board Member: [Zach](https://twitter.com/zachobront)
- Board Member: [Roman](https://twitter.com/r_krasiuk)
- Board Member: [Jepsen](https://twitter.com/0xjepsen)
- OP Labs Representative (non-voting): [Kelvin](https://twitter.com/kelvinfichter)

All members will be subject to the [[Code of Conduct]]. If a member of the Developer Advisory Board is unable to fulfil the responsibilities listed below, they may publicly step down and the Foundation (Grants Council, in future Seasons) should appoint a replacement by no later than the end of the next Voting Cycle.

### Future Appointments

The Developer Advisory Board will need to be re-appointed by the Grants Council each Season as the members of the Grants Council must be re-elected and are subject to change. As the expertise represented on the Grants Council changes, the composition of the advisory board may also need to change.

Future appointees of the board should be selected considering the below qualities:

- Must have:
    - history of development in the Optimism and/or Ethereum ecosystem
    - deep understanding of developments in the Optimism ecosystem
    - ability to dedicate sufficient time fulfilling member responsibilities
- Nice to have:
    - experience with security and or auditing
    - experience evaluating technical grants (examples include, but are not limited to, evaluating grants for the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, and/or other protocol grant programs)

## Member Responsibilities

- Review all Delegate Mission Request drafts under Intent #1 and provide feedback/reasoning if the Developer Advisory Board’s approval is NOT provided on any proposal drafts before deadlines. The Developer Advisory Board is encouraged to create a public rubric, using a rubric process similar to that of the Grants Council.
    
- Provide a statement on each approved Delegate Mission Request either affirming why it’s important or registering skepticism as to its technical merits.
    
- Work with the Grants Council to assess the merits of Mission Applications under Intent #1. The Developer Advisory Board may also assess the technical merits of Mission Applications under other Intents, but it is not required.
    
- Assess the completion of technical milestones related to Intent #1 Missions and/or Mission Requests for other Intents that the Developer Advisory Board has advised the Council on.
    
- Members may also create their own Delegate Mission Requests, but are not required to do so.
    
- Members should expect to dedicate 5-8 hours per week, on average, to these responsibilities.
    
- The Advisory Board Lead should:
    
    - publish the board’s [internal operating procedures](https://gov.optimism.io/t/grants-council-internal-operating-procedures/4832) before the beginning of Season 5
    - facilitate coordination of board member review and host regular board meetings, which should occur at least once per Grants Cycle (every 6 weeks.) It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the community
    - run a process to ensure milestones on technical Missions have been met before milestone-based dispersements are made
    - exercise decision-making authority in the event that the board cannot come to consensus on an administrative or operational matter

## Advisory Board Budget

We propose an initial budget of 12,500 OP per Advisory Board Member (excluding the OP Labs representative) and 20,000 OP for the Advisory Board Lead, for a total budget of 70,000 OP to be dispersed at the end of Season 5. The initial budget will be important to attract top talent, but we believe the contributions of the Developer Advisory Board are highly conducive to RetroPGF funding and recommend the board be primarily rewarded retroactively.

**Consistent with other reward allocations, all Developer Advisory Board rewards will be subject to a KYC and claims flow process.**

# What does it Mean for Delegates?

Delegates will need to approve the Developer Advisory Board budget and ratify its membership in Special Voting Cycle ``#16a``. If approved, the Developer Advisory Board will have ample time to establish its internal operating procedures before the start of Season 5.
