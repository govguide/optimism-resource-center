- Each voter will be able to mint an Optimist PFP ahead of public mint in 2023 ✨

### Welcome 🔴✨

Dear Badgeholders,

If you’re reading this manual, you likely are already familiar with the context around OP’s RetroPGF experiments. If you’d like a refresher, please read through our recent [[Introducing the Citizens’ House - 10m OP to Public Goods|RetroPGF Round 2 announcement post]] or visit our [governance documentation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/citizens-house/).

We are excited to welcome your expertise into the initial iteration of the Optimism Citizens’ House. As a citizen, your primary responsibility at this stage is to help allocate public goods funding in the Optimism ecosystem.

This document is your guide to voting in RetroPGF 2.

# 📌 The Basics

_RetroPGF 2 consists of several phases. Your primary responsibility is in Step **3. Voting**._

### 1. **Badgeholder distribution**

From **Dec 3 → Jan 15**, the Optimism Foundation will reach out to potential badgeholders to collect voting addresses and contact information. If you accept your voting badge, you will be given write access a public Discord channel that we’ll use as our primary communication channel.

 > [!info]- ✨ More info on Voting Badge distribution criteria
 > ✨ Voting Badges for RetroPGF 2 will be distributed to a set of **90 community members.**
 > 1. **One badge distributed to each voter from RetroPGF Round 1**, excluding full time employees of OP Labs or the Optimism Foundation. (14 badges, [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g4ilAByMNQsmlBC8cskQip7Ojd_qK6IhozJCyoVfU9k/edit#gid=0))
  >  2. **One badge given to an individual selected by each of the previous voters in RetroPGF Round 1** (14 badges)
   > 3. **One badge given to 10 Token House delegates, selected by a Token House vote** (10 badges)
   > 4. **One badge given to an individual selected by each of the badge-holding Token House delegates in (3) above** (10 badges)
   > 5. **Twenty-one badges distributed to unaffiliated community contributors chosen by the Optimism Foundation** (21 badges)
    >6. **Twenty-one badges distributed to individuals selected by each badge-holding community contributor in (5)** **above** (21 badges)
    >
    > Notes
    >
    >  - Note that holding a voting badge for one round does not guarantee voting rights in subsequent rounds; Citizenship criteria are subject to change going forward.
    >  - Voting Badges in RetroPGF 2 are recorded as a simple attestation in the AttestationStation, not as a soulbound token. This approach preserves flexibility for future iterations.
    >  - Badgeholders are expected to adhere to the Optimism [[Code of Conduct]].
    >  - An individual does not have to accept the voting badge. If an eligible person declines, the badge will not be distributed to someone else.
    >  - Anyone holding a Voting Badge will be able to mint an Optimist NFT – the inception of identity on Optimism.
    >  - Badgeholders with any participation or ownership stake in a project up for vote in RetroPGF 2 will be expected to not vote in favor of that project. Rules around conflicts of interest will be itemized in a forthcoming Badgeholder Manual.
    >  - Citizens’ House adheres to “one person one vote.” If an individual falls into more than one category above or is nominated more than once, they will still receive only one voting badge. 

> [!info]- 🗣 More info on badgeholder outreach and comms
 > Voting badges will be distributed to 90 community members. (That’s you!)
 > Optimism Foundation will reach out to each badgeholders via Twitter, email, Discord, or with any other available contact info.
 > - Optimism will collect each voter’s **Discord handle** and the **Optimism** **address** they want to use for voting. Voters may optionally provide TG or email as well.
 > - For badgeholders who can nominate another voter, OP will collect a Discord handle and Optimism address for their nomination.
 > - Primary communication will take place through a public Discord channel on the Optimism server (anyone can read, only Badgeholders can post).

### 2. **Project Nominations**

From **Jan 17 → Jan 31,** any community member can nominate a **project or person** for funding by posting on the **[Optimism Governance Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/).** Nominated projects must complete a profile in the RetroPGF application manager in order to be eligible for voting.

As a badgeholder, you are welcome to nominate projects yourself. You’re also welcome to engage in public discussion on the types of nominations you’d like to see.

 > [!info]- 🙋🏻‍♀️ More info on Voting Badge distribution criteria
 > 📝 **FOR PEOPLE AND PROJECTS**
 > Nominations for projects will take place on three different threads on [gov.optimism.io](http://optimism.gov.io/) – one thread for each category of public good within [[RetroPGF Round 2|scope for this round]].
 > 
 > To nominate a project or person, any community member can comment on the thread with:
 >    - the project or person’s name
 >    - a description of how they’ve provided public good to the Collective
 >    - a link to the project or person’s GitHub or Twitter
 >    - (optional) contact info for the project or person.
 > 
 > This thread may get noisy. Nominations will be reviewed for spam and fraud, described in more detail in (3)
 > 
 > 📮 **FOR “COLLECTIONS”**
 > The Foundation may also nominate collections for funding. A collection is different from a project in that a collection may not have a single entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter. Optimism’s Support NERDs or the set of code contributors to the Optimism monorepo are both examples of potential collections.
 > 
 > To nominate a collection, the Foundation must comment on a forum thread with the collection’s name, the list of addresses in the collection, the breakdown of how funding would be distributed across those addresses, and a description of how they’ve provided public good to the Collective.
 > 
 > Collections will be posted before the project nomination deadline on Jan 31.
 > 
 > Because of the high risk for fraud, collections will only be nominated by the Foundation in this next round of RetroPGF. We anticipate collections will make up < 10% of the possible funding targets in this round.

 > [!info]- 🪀 Project submission via RetroPGF application manager
 > Any project that has been nominated must complete a project profile in the RetroPGF application manager in order to be eligible for voting.
 > 
 > The link to create a project profile will be shared at the beginning of the project nomination window. The Optimism Foundation will attempt to inform any project nominated on the Forum to complete the opt-in process.
 > 
 > After project nominations close, the Optimism Foundation will review completed profile submissions for spam and fraud.
 > 
 > Any project without a correctly verified GitHub or Twitter account, any project impersonating another team, or any project without a complete profile may be hidden from the voting round at the Foundation’s discretion.

### 3. **Voting**

Your time to shine! From **Mar 9 → Mar 23 19:00 GMT**, you will cast your vote on how to allocate 10m OP tokens across all the projects that were nominated. Voting will take place via a web UI built by OP Labs.

> **More detail on how to evaluate projects and vote is included in the `Voting` section below** ⤵️

### 4. **Funding dispersal**

After voting concludes on **March 23**, Optimism will aggregate badgeholder preferences via a simple average, publish the final funding amount for each project, and distribute funds.

### 5. **Community retrospective**

To submit feedback on your experience go 👉 [here](https://app.deform.cc/form/4f4727da-0c67-4f3b-b19e-da54f85a7865) 👈 At the conclusion of RetroPGF 2, Optimism Foundation will conduct a retrospective and gather community feedback

# Discover Nominated Projects & Collections

You can discover nominated projects and collections via the [RetroPGF web app](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery) ✨

![[Screenshot_2023-03-08_at_14.27.58.png]]
*Find nominated projects and collections here 👉[RetroPGF app](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery)👈*

All projects that were nominated and opted-in are displayed at [https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery).

You can sort projects either randomly or alphabetically by clicking on “Sort by” and you can filter projects based on their category (Infrastructure, Tooling and utilities and Education).

When you click into a project, you can read their own description about the impact they had, their sources of funding, and team size.

You can save Projects that you’re interested in by clicking on the `❤️` icon, and you can filter to see your saved projects on the landing page.

**Nominated Collections**

In addition to a total of 189 projects, Round 2 will also have 5 collections that are nominated. A collection is different from a project in that a collection may not have a single entity that can be verified via GitHub or Twitter. Optimism’s Support NERDs or the set of code contributors to the Optimism monorepo are both examples of **collections.**

collections are made up of a list of contributors and a weighting of how rewards should be split between them (distribution points). Nominated for this round are Optimism [SupportNERDs](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/support-nerds), [Translators](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/translators) and [Ambassadors](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/ambassadors) , as well as [EIP4844 contributors](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/eip-4844) and [Optimism Monorepo dependencies](https://app.optimism.io/retropgf-discovery/monorepo-dependencies).

These collections were nominated by the Optimism Foundation. In future rounds, community members will have the ability to nominate collections as well. If a contributor in a collection rejects the rewards, fails to respond to outreach by the Optimism team, or fails to comply with the KYC process, the rewards allocated to that contributor will go back into the RetroPGF token allocation.

# 🗳 Voting

### What you’re voting on

**RetroPGF 2 will fund public goods that support the development and usage of the OP Stack**.

The OP Stack is a series of open source modules, built by the Optimism Collective, that work together to form coherent, reliable blockchains. At the most basic level, the OP Stack can be thought of as the software that sits within the [Optimism monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) and powers Optimism Mainnet. More than just code though, the OP Stack is the foundation for an entire open source software community.

RetroPGF should reward the OSS contributions which make the OP Stack possible and successful. We’ve outlined three categories of projects and contributions that support the development and usage of the OP Stack in different ways.

They are:

- **Infrastructure + Dependencies**: Software used to build or deploy the OP Stack; contributions to protocols or standards the OP Stack depends on; experiments that support or inform future development of the core OP Stack protocol
- **Tooling + Utilities**: Work that helps builders create applications on Optimism mainnet, build on the OP Stack, interact with governance of the Collective, or use applications built on Optimism
- **Education**: Work to spread awareness and knowledge of how Optimism works, whether technically or socially

Note: The OP Stack refers to the OSS code powering Optimism. Today, this means the Optimism monorepo and its dependencies. Eligible projects **need not** be exclusive to the Optimism ecosystem, but there should be a connection. For example,

- **go-ethereum** is an important dependency of the OP Stack, but is not Optimism-specific.
- **Ethereum L2 explorer pages** which give stats on various L2s provide educational impact for the OP Stack, but are not Optimism-specific

While this round starts by focusing on the OP Stack, we expect these categories to include many projects working primarily outside the Optimism ecosystem. Because the OP Stack benefits from their impact, it’s important to fund them. (As an example—because [Ethereum Equivalence is core to the next big release](https://dev.optimism.io/introducing-optimism-bedrock/), existing Ethereum node software has had a massive impact on the OP Stack)

### The impact framework

One of Optimism’s core values is `Impact = Profit`. In this round of RetroPGF, your job as a voter is to allocate votes accordingly. For RGPF Round 2, impact is a function of advancing the development and usage of the OP Stack.

We’ve explained above what ‘advancing the development and usage of the OP Stack’ means. But how would you determine which applicants do this more than others? Given two candidates that contribute to the development and usage of the OP Stack, how do you evaluate?

- **Importance** - how essential the contributions of the actor _have been_ to the development and usage of the OP Stack. Ask yourself, “_If this project disappeared tomorrow, would the OP ecosystem notice?” “If they had disappeared a year ago, would the OP ecosystem be worse for wear?”_

    Consider that essential contributions might not be visible to the public, just like the critical (and often invisible) infrastructure that underlies real-world cities. Your job as a badgeholder is to equally weigh parks and sewers in terms of relative importance. Remember, you’re rewarding preexisting (retroactive) impact, not future impact!
    <br>
- **Outside** **Funding Availability** - how little funding would be available to the actor otherwise. Ask yourself, “*Without the funding received from this Round of RetroPGF, would this actor be fairly compensated for the value they’ve created?”*

    In keeping with the principle of `impact = profit`, funding availability is an important concern in determining how to allocate RetroPGF funding. For a nuanced discussion of the pros and cons of “means testing,” see Vitalik’s retrospective [blog post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/11/16/retro1.html) of RetroPGF Round 1.
    

### How to evaluate

Allocating funding is never a perfect process. You may not feel like an expert on a given project, or it may be challenging to compare projects directly based on your assessment of their impact and funding availability. Here are some considerations to use throughout the process.

- **Don’t fake expertise. You are voting for _you_ — not for all badgeholders.**

    You are not individually responsible for knowing everything about every OP Stack funding category. Some of you might experts in education, some of you might be deeply experienced in technical infrastructure. To make an informed vote you can rely on the expertise of other badgeholders that you trust and we urge you to share your own expertise with others. In the run-up to the voting period we will create different formats for badgeholders to share their expertise.
    <br>
- **Make sense together**

    You are welcome and encouraged to engage with other badgeholders and the broader Optimism community in determining how to evaluate project impact. Optimism will host a series of community calls to review project nominations and compare notes. (The dates for these calls will be posted in the Badgeholder Discord channel as well as by @OptimismGov on Twitter.) You are also welcome to discuss your thinking publicly.
    <br>
- **Feel free to make wholistic impact determinations, but when in doubt, don’t make assumptions.**

    A combination of application data and external research should leave you qualified to make an informed decision about a given applicant. Still, there might be some projects whose impact argument is more interpretive or unquantifiable (especially in the education category). You should feel fine using your gut in these situations, but be careful not to be _**too**_ charitable with a given applicant. If a given impact argument seems like too much of a stretch, then it probably is.
    

### How to vote

Voting will be open from **March 9 → March 23 19:00 GMT**. To vote, you must be able to sign a message with the Optimism address you provided in the Badgeholder intake form.

Voting will be done via a form where you must allocate 0-100% of your voting weight across any number of projects. Abstaining from the vote will not change the overall amount of funding allocated in RetroPGF 2.

The form won’t show you the votes you already allocated, because of this it can be easy to lose track. We recommend that you decide on how to allocate your votes beforehand. To do this you can use this **[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V7FAydlEzFO-IvNKRD2ZKKE6xyA4KygjGijAmdgkQAo/edit?usp=sharing)**, to use it just click “File” and “Make a copy”.

After voting concludes on **March 23**, Optimism will aggregate badgeholder preferences via a simple average, publish the final funding amount for each project, and distribute funds.

# ✨ Optimist NFT Beta

The Optimism team has been working on a PFP collection to serve as the foundation for identity across the Optimism ecosystem. The vision is that this NFT represents you as an individual Optimist, and evolves to reflect your identity and reputation across the city as you interact with different projects and protocols.

We’ll gradually introduce waves of eligible minters starting in Q1 2023 based on activity, identity, and community contributions.

As a voter in RetroPGF 2, you are the ✨ first wave of individuals ✨ eligible to mint! Head to [app.optimism.io/optimist-nft](http://app.optimism.io/optimist-nft) to mint.

If you’re interested in participating in some optional user research around the mint experience, feel free to schedule 15min with our product team here :)

# ⚙️ Ops & Administration

### Public Communication

The success of this funding mechanism depends in part on widespread awareness of it.

You are welcome to discuss your role in RetroPGF, your vantage point of the funding round, and your process for evaluating Projects.

There will be 2x “badgeholder discussions” held either in Discord or over video. Your attendance is optional but encouraged. The purpose of these conversations is to review Project nominations and discuss the relative impact on the scope of this funding round and the overall Collective.

### Internal Communication

Our main communication forum will be a channel in Optimism’s Discord. The channel is visible to the public, but only voters can post. Announcements and updates will be posted regularly to this channel.

We also ask for an email address or Telegram handle for backup and 1:1 communication in case we need to contact you directly.

If you have questions you’d like to ask 1:1, you can email [jonas@optimism.io](mailto:jonas@optimism.io).

### Conduct

Voters in RetroPGF are expected to abide by the [Optimism Delegate Code of Conduct](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-code-of-conduct/3943). Violation of the Code of Conduct may result in removal of voting rights in RetroPGF 2 or beyond.

In RetroPGF 2, the Foundation will manage enforcement for all types of Citizens’ House violations.

Note that the Code of Conduct includes a “conflicts of interest” section.

### Feedback

To submit feedback on your experience go 👉 [here](https://app.deform.cc/form/4f4727da-0c67-4f3b-b19e-da54f85a7865) 👈

Optimism plans to iterate regularly on RetroPGF. The scope for Round 3 will be announced at the close of Round 2.

Community feedback is key to helping the process improve with each round. We welcome your notes, reflections, and feedback at any step. We just ask that you consider your reach and audience, and try to avoid undermining the legitimacy of the process while it’s being run.

The Foundation will run a public community retrospective after the round ends.

## FAQs

- **Can you make determinations for a project’s eligibility based on information that isn’t contained in its application?**

    Yes, you may make decisions about how to vote based on what you know about a project even beyond its individual application.
    <br>
- **Can you allocate all your votes to one project?**

    We discourage this! You’re voting on the distribution of all 10M OP for this round, please make sense together with other badgeholders to realize this task.
    <br>
- **Can you vote for projects that you have personal connections to? (i.e. social or business connections that would introduce bias)**

    Delegates are expected to NOT cast votes in favor of any project they have a financial or reputational stake in. See the Optimism Delegate Code of Conduct for more information. If you are unsure about whether a specific relationship counts as a conflict of interest, feel free to reach out to [jonas@optimism.io](mailto:jonas@optimism.io).
    <br>
- **Can you vote based on expectation of impact in the future instead of just past evidence?**

    Voters should evaluate projects based on past impact, not on prospective future impact. “Past impact” should ideally be evaluated as time since Nov 1, 2021 when Optimism conducted its most recent round of RetroPGF.
    <br>
- **What happens if I don’t vote in time?**

    Votes should be cast by 19:00 GMT on Thursday, March 23rd. If your vote has not been cast by then, it will not be counted. This will not change the overall amount of funding distributed in RetroPGF 2.
    <br>
- **Are my responses recorded?**

    Individual votes will not be made public by Optimism, but delegates are welcome to disclose their votes on their own.
    <br>
- **Can I talk to other badge holders about my allocation strategy?**

    Yes! Collective sense-making is welcome. One of our main areas of interest and exploration is how the social experience of badgeholders affects voting outcomes. We look forward to your feedback.
