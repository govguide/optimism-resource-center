## About RetroPGF 3

[[RetroPGF Round 3|RetroPGF 3]] will allocate 30m OP tokens to reward contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism.

Every type of developer and contributor is eligible for RetroPGF. It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that Optimism pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that Optimists love. **If you’re providing impact, you are eligible!**

Your application will be used by badgeholders to decide on how much OP you should receive **based on the impact you already had on the Optimism Collective**. We recommend you take time to fill out your application and start early.

**Note**: You are only evaluated based on the impact you already had. Do not mention or allude to your future work or future impact. This is **retroactive** public goods funding, not proactive funding!

## Impact Statement ✨

**Describing your Contributions**

This first section is all about what you’ve built. It doesn’t matter if you’re building a consumer app, a key piece of infra that Optimism pays for, or a free-to-use community tool that Optimists love. If you’re providing impact, you are eligible!

- Clearly state the problems you've solved and for whom
- Be sure to provide the most important information in the first few sentences.
- Try to be specific and avoid jargon.
- Don’t allude to your future plans or make promises of future work - this could lead to your application being disqualified.

**Contribution links** Help badgeholders see your work firsthand by linking to specific resources and describe what you’re linking to and why it’s relevant.

- Link to specific resources that showcase your contributions (e.g. Github Repos, Onchain contracts, Mirror articles, etc.)
- Provide a description of the resource you’re linking to

**Selecting your impact category** The categories are structured to describe who benefited from your contribution. The categories are used for badgeholders to understand how your contributions have supported the development and adoption of Optimism.

- You can select multiple categories, but try to select the categories that best describe your impact!
- RetroPGF rewards will be allocated based on the assessment of your individual profile. Selecting all categories will not yield an advantage in the evaluation of your project.

**Describing your impact**

In this section you can highlight the impact your contributions had on Optimism. Try to be specific on what impact your contribution had on the Collective, and who benefited from your contribution.

- Explain the tangible and intangible benefits of your contributions.
- Describe the types of Optimists, projects and companies benefited from your contribution

**Impact Metrics** Impact metrics allow you to highlight quantitative or qualitative metrics that measure the impact of your contribution. Ask yourself what metrics you can highlight that showcase how your contributions have **supported the development and adoption of Optimism**.

- Verifiable - be sure to include links to data sources that badgeholders can use to verify your metrics.
- Important - ensure that the metric is a good indicator of your impact.
    - How many txns have been completed through your application? How many of your event attendees have increased their participation in the Optimism Collective?
- Each category has a success criteria associated with it. If you’re choosing a category, be sure to connect your impact description and metrics to the way your contributions helped drive towards that category’s success metric!

## Grants and Funding

Badgeholders must understand how much OP, revenue, or funding you have already received for their contributions. This allows RetroPGF to fairly compensate impact to the Collective.

**The more accurate this information is, the more likely you will receive the right amount of RetroPGF.** You only need to add information about grants or revenue related to the contributions you’re looking to receive RetroPGF for.
- List funding and grants that directly or indirectly relate to your contribution
    - Did you receive a grant for your contribution?
    - Did users pay for your contribution?
    - Did you receive donations for your contribution?
- If you received a grant from the Token House (Missions, grants council, etc.), you must report this under the “Governance fund” category.
- You do not need to provide VC funding or other investments in your project or person.
- If you’re applying for contributions made over a long period, you should at a minimum report grants and funding received since 01.06.2022.
