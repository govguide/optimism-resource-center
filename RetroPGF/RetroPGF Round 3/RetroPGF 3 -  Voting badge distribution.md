# RetroPGF 3: Voting badge distribution

Voting badges for [[RetroPGF Round 3|RetroPGF 3]] will be offered to 208 community members:

1. Each badgeholder who voted in RetroPGF 2 will receive a new voting badge (69), and will be able to distribute a voting badge to one community member of their choosing.
    
2. The top 50 recipients of RetroPGF 2 will be able to distribute a voting badge to one community member of their choosing.
    
3. The Optimism Foundation will distribute 10 voting badges, each of whom will be able to distribute a voting badge to one community member of their choosing.
    

## Rules and Code of Conduct

Badgeholders must abide by the following rules and the [[Code of Conduct]]. In case of a violation, the voting badge that has been distributed may be revoked.

- As a round 2 badgeholder, you’re not allowed to distribute your voting badge to a co-worker with whom you work on your primary project. “Primary” is defined as a project to which you dedicate >25% of working hours or derive >25% of your compensation.  
    This rule is established to counteract the concentration of voting badges among the members of a small number of projects.
    
- Badgeholders represent individual members of the Optimism Collective. They can not represent a project or company in their capacity as badgeholders.
    

## How to distribute your voting badge

The Optimism Foundation will distribute badges using the following guidelines, and encourages others to consider these criteria in their own distribution:

💡 Can this person help advance the process and structure of RetroPGF as a funding mechanism?

🔎 Is this person a domain expert in any of the categories up for funding in RetroPGF?

🌱 Has this person shown strong alignment with the long term growth of the Optimism ecosystem and the mission of the Collective?

🫂 Can this person expand the diversity of viewpoints and insights from which evaluations are made?

**Distribute your badge**

- If you’re a badgeholder, please use [this form](https://app.deform.cc/form/f08a65d7-ac0d-4054-8b55-8c89b66f7cb7) to tell us who should receive a voting badge.
- If you’re one of the top 50 recipients of RetroPGF 2, please use [this form](https://app.deform.cc/form/0b2b8e01-eac1-4e86-b6d2-d14ec88b4ddd).
- The deadline to distribute your voting badge is September 15th and the distribution will be published.

**Disclaimer**: In the future, the criteria for citizenship will be determined by governance. Voting in RetroPGF 3 does not guarantee permanent participation in the Citizens’ House and future iterations of RetroPGF.

# Why this badgeholder selection method?

This distribution method is rooted in our [[RetroPGF2 - Learnings & Reflections|learnings from RetroPGF 2]]

- Similar to [[RetroPGF Round 2|Round 2 of RetroPGF]], each badgeholder who voted in the previous round of RetroPGF gets to distribute one voting badge. Previously, we’ve seen that extending the small trusted set of badgeholders by allowing each individual to add a new badgeholder to the group resulted in a highly committed & value aligned set of voters in round 2.
    
    - In the past we observed that badgeholders tended to pass their voting badge to their teammates, leading to potential centralization. To counteract this, we now prohibit badgeholders from nominating coworkers (see “Rules and Code of Conduct”)
- The [top 50 recipients](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13QTVuv4HTTDBctRxuqngECUMc70QP4usbmcFT8XT-GI/edit?usp=sharing) from RetroPGF round 2 have shown strong alignment with Optimism’s values and have an interest in ensuring a fair RetroPGF process moving forward. This will also serve as an experiment to understand if receiving RetroPGF could be a viable citizenship selection method in the future.
    
- The Optimism Foundation will distribute a limited number of badges using the criteria outlined above. The Foundation is not expecting to participate in the selection of badgeholders/citizens in future rounds of RetroPGF.
    

# The future of Citizenship Selection

Ownership over citizenship distribution will eventually be the responsibility of [[The Future of Optimism Governance|Optimism's two-house governance system]] and will be issued based on the [reputation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/) that Optimism Collective members have earned. We invite badgeholders and community members to discuss what reputation-attributes (in the form of [attestations](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/)) could be valuable for future Citizenship selection in [**this thread**](https://gov.optimism.io/t/future-citizenship-selection-criteria/6558) ! 👈

This will allow the Collective to make the necessary preparations for future citizenship selection ✨
