### Badgeholder Attestations

All voting badges are recorded as attestations via the Ethereum Attestation Service:

- You can find the badgeholder attestation schema [here](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xfdcfdad2dbe7489e0ce56b260348b7f14e8365a8a325aef9834818c00d46b31b)

- Each attestation includes a “refferedMethod” and “Referred By” field, allowing for the traceability of how the badgeholder was selected to participate.

### The future of Citizenship Selection

Ownership over citizenship distribution will eventually be the responsibility of [[The Future of Optimism Governance|Optimism's two-house governance system]] and will be issued based on the [reputation](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/) that Optimism Collective members have earned. We invite badgeholders and community members to discuss what reputation-attributes (in the form of [attestations](https://community.optimism.io/docs/identity/)) could be valuable for future Citizenship selection in [**this thread**](https://gov.optimism.io/t/future-citizenship-selection-criteria/6558) 👈
