## Voting

ðŸ‘‰ Voting was live from November 6th - December 7th. There were two applications badgeholders could use to vote in RetroPGF 3:

- West - https://round3.optimism.io/
- Agora - https://vote.optimism.io/

In addition, there's useful tooling that has been built to support badgeholders:

- [Pairwise](https://www.pairwise.vote/) - Gamifying list creation by categorizing applicants into small groups for experts' pairwise comparison.
- [OpenSource Observer](https://www.opensource.observer/) - An Analytics platform for impact metrics on RetroPGF applications

Badgeholders can find all the information relevant for voting in the [Badgeholder Manual](https://www.optimism.io/badgeholder-manual)

## FAQ

> [!question]- Did my contribution need to have taken place between the end of round 2 and beginning of round 3?
 > No, all contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism are considered, no matter when they took place.

> [!question]- Were projects nominated?
> There was no nomination process, instead projects directly applied for RetroPGF 3.

> [!question]- Are VC funded teams or teams that received a grant from the Optimism Token House eligible for RetroPGF?
> Yes, both VC funded teams as well as teams that received a grant from the Token House are eligble. Badgeholders uphold the principle of "impact = profit", where individuals should receive profit equal to the impact they provided to the Optimism Collective.

> [!question]- If I received rewards in RetroPGF 2, was I able to sign up for Round 3 with the same contribution?
> Yes, you were able to apply again with the same contribution. We asked that you include the rewards you received in Round 2 in your "Grants and Funding" section of your application.

> [!question]- Are RetroPGF rewards subject to a 1 year lock-up?
> No, RetroPGF rewards are not subject to a 1 year lock-up. After the round concludes, projects will need to complete a KYC process with the Optimism Foundation and will then gradually receive their RetroPGF rewards over a 90 day period.

> [!question]- Are RetroPGF 3 rewards sourced from sequencer revenue or RetroPGF token allocation?
> Round 3 rewards are sourced from the [[OP Allocations|RetroPGF token allocation]]. Future rounds of RetroPGF may allocate surplus protocol revenue.

> [!question]- Does my Project need to be on OP mainnet to be eligible?
> No, your project does not need to be on OP mainnet. As long as youâ€™re providing impact to the Optimism Collective, you are eligible for RetroPGF!
