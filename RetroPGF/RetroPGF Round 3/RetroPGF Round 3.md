## FAQ

> [!question]- Does my contribution need to have taken place between the end of round 2 and beginning of round 3?
 > No, all contributions that have supported the development and adoption of Optimism are considered, no matter when they took place

> [!question]- Where can I nominate Projects?
> There will be no nominations process, projects will directly apply for RetroPGF 3. So let your favorite project know they should sign up!

> [!question]- Are VC funded teams or teams that received a grant from the Optimism Token House eligible for RetroPGF?
> Yes, both VC funded teams as well as teams that receive a grant from the Token House are eligble. Badgeholders uphold the principle of "impact = profit", where individuals should receive profit equal to the impact they provided to the Optimism Collective.

> [!question]- If I received rewards in RetroPGF 2, can I sign up for Round 3 with the same contribution?
> Yes, you can apply again with the same contribution. Be sure to include the rewards you received in Round 2 in your "Grants and Funding" section of your application.

> [!question]- Are RetroPGF rewards subject to a 1 year lock-up?
> No, RetroPGF rewards are not subject to a 1 year lock-up. After the round concludes, projects will need to complete a KYC process with the Optimism Foundation and will then gradually receive their RetroPGF rewards over a 90 day period.

> [!question]- Are RetroPGF 3 rewards sourced from sequencer revenue or RetroPGF token allocation?
> Round 3 rewards are sourced from the [[OP Allocations|RetroPGF token allocation]]. Future rounds of RetroPGF may allocate surplus protocol revenue.

> [!question]- Does my Project need to be on OP mainnet to be eligible?
> No, your project does not need to be on OP mainnet. As long as youâ€™re providing impact to the Optimism Collective, you are eligible for RetroPGF!
