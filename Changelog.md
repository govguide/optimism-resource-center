This changelog page was started recently, and isn't quite as exhaustive as the [Commits history](https://github.com/govguide/optimism-resource-center/commits/main) that can be found in the ``optimism-resource-center`` GitHub repo.

To ensure that the Resource Center is always up to date, we are currently experimenting with a scraper bot that notifies us by email when changes are made to the original source material in the Governance Forum, Community Hub or GitHub.
