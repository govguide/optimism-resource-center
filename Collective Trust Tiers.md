Over time, Trust Tiers will become more robust as they incorporate Attestations and impact scores derived from one’s activity in the ecosystem.

This is the first iteration of Collective Trust Tiers, which we will run as an experiment in Season 4. Both Tiers and their criteria are subject to change based on feedback. If continued for future Seasons, they may be ratified by the Token House. Over time, we expect Tiers to be based on Collectively agreed upon trust scores, calculated using Attestations.

**Initially, Trust Tiers will be used to:**

- Establish transparent standards for contribution and grant eligibility, specifically:
    - Determining appropriate grant sizes for grants made by the Grants Council
    - Determining funding eligibility for different Alliances proposing [[Token House Missions|Missions]]
    - Specifying which Alliances may apply for [Foundation Missions (RFPs)](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1)
- Help people understand the types of contributions (and, over time, Attestations) we think are important for establishing the basis of reputation in the Collective
