## Token House Code of Conduct Council Charter

A [[Code of Conduct]] went into affect in December 2021. The Code of Conduct is critical to maintaining a healthy governance community that all delegates feel welcome engaging in, thereby increasing the accessibility of Optimism governance.

The Foundation currently plays an administrative role in processing Code of Conduct violation reports and the Token House votes on enforcement of valid violation reports. The community has [expressed interest](https://gov.optimism.io/t/delegate-suspension-fractal-visions/5710/28) in a more rigorous enforcement process while other delegates have expressed that they are uncomfortable voting directly on Code of Conduct Violation proposals.

The Foundation accepted two submissions to [RFP #2](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2) aimed at the prevention of Code of Conduct violations in the first place:

- [GravityDAOs conflict resolution trainings](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2#issuecomment-1735889641)
- [rnDAOs community health analytics dashboard](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/2#issuecomment-1731786922)

Season 5 will further decentralize the Foundation’s role in processing violations of the Code of Conduct and remove enforcement responsibility from Token House delegates. Accordingly, the Foundation will authorize a Token House Code of Conduct Council, according to the [[Collective Council Framework|Council Framework]].

## Goals

- Replace the Foundation in the processing of reported Code of Conduct Violations
- Eliminate enforcement responsibilities for Token House delegates by entrusting the Code of Conduct Council to process disputes. To create accountability for the Code of Conduct Council, the Token House may veto enforcement actions at any time
    - Please note that due to the experimental nature of the Code of Conduct Council and the high security requirements of the [[Security Council Charter v0.1|Security Council]], any Code of Conduct Violation reports related to members of the Security Council will still be subject to a full Token House vote, following the process under Code of Conduct Violation proposals (the operating manual will be updated shortly to reflect Season 5 updates.)
- Process any violation reports filed in the Citizens’ House that involve a member of the Citizens’ House Code of Conduct Council

## Council Structure

The Council will be comprised of five members and a Council Lead. Decisions will be made based on a simple majority of members, using a 1 member = 1 vote model to determine both the level of violation (temporary suspension or severe violation) and whether or not a violation occurred.

## Membership

- The Council Lead will be appointed by the Foundation in the first Season and subsequently elected. The Council Lead is a non-voting member of the Council.
- Council members will be elected by the Token House in Special Voting Cycle ``#16b``
- Anyone may self-nominate themselves in the week prior to Special Voting Cycle ``#16b`` but:
    - Token House Code of Conduct Council members cannot be badgeholders
    - Token House Code of Conduct Council members must have completed GravityDAO’s conflict resolution training (online or live) by the start of Season 5
- As with all Councils, membership must be renewed / elected at the start of each Season

## Member Responsibilities

- All Council members should:
    
    - Process all Code of Conduct Violation reports, excluding Grant Misusage reports which will still go to a full Token House vote, by the end of the nearest review period. If the end of the nearest review period is less than 3 days away, the report may be processed by the end of the next nearest review period.
    - Publish a summary of any enforcement decisions made during the Voting Cycle to the forum by the end of the review period of each voting cycle (Wednesday at 19:00 GMT.) This report will be added to the Voting Roundup and optimistically approved. In this context, optimistic approval means the Council’s decisions are assumed to be approved unless the Token House explicitly vetos an enforcement action. If any of the enforcements receive >12% of the votable supply in `no` votes, that enforcement action will go to a full Token House vote in the next Voting Cycle and no enforcement action should be taken in the interim.
    - Process any violation reports filed in the Citizens’ House that involve a member of the Citizens’ House Code of Conduct Council
- The Council Lead should:
    
    - Facilitate coordination of review and host regular Council meetings, which should occur at least once per Voting Cycle in which reports are filed. It is suggested that meeting minutes or summaries be made available to the community.
    - Exercise decision-making authority in the event that the Council cannot come to consensus on an administrative or operational matter (ie. act as a tie breaker)
- Warnings may still be administered by the support NERDs and/or the Foundation
    

## Council Budget

- Each Council member will receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the end of the Season
- As the activity level of the Code of Conduct Councils is unknown in advance (as it depends on the number of reports and disputes per Season), the majority of rewards for Code of Conduct Councils should be granted retroactively via RetroPGF
