<span class="notvisible"></span>
Scope: This Code of Conduct applies to all delegates, Citizens, and grant recipients (“Optimists”). This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual is representing the community in public, either online or offline.

The [[Rules of Engagement 2.0|Rules of Engagement]] apply to anyone using the Forum (Discourse), Discord, and Reddit. **Severe Violations are now enforced via the Rules of Engagement**

Optimist behavior should be aligned with [Optimist Expectations](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241)

Optimists should actively discourage others from breaking community standards. Optimists should report serious or repeat offenses, as outlined in the relevant documentation. Violations that are reported using any other process will not be addressed.

Policies in the Code of Conduct go into effect at the time they are included in the Code of Conduct and do not apply retroactively.

The Code of Conduct will not cover all possible scenarios and edge cases. We ask that Optimists please act in accordance with the spirit of the Code of Conduct and refrain from exploiting loopholes that may exist.

## Severe Violations are now enforced via the [[Rules of Engagement 2.0|Rules of Engagement]]

---

## Inclusivity, Extreme Civility, Good Faith and Best Interest, and Due Care and Attention are all [[Optimist Expectations]].

**These expectations should be reflected in delegation (or via undelegating for failure to uphold them) and may be considered in future Citizenship criteria.**

---

## Accountability

- Collective Council and Advisory Board Members must uphold the responsibilities outlined in the corresponding Charters. Failure of Council members to uphold their responsibilities is grounds for Collective Council or Advisory Board Member Removal, as outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]] (update coming soon!)

- Mandatory (Violation 1): All grant recipients must abide by the Collective Grant Policies, outlined [[Collective Grant Policies|here]]. These policies have been updated to include clauses that were previously outlined in the Code of Conduct, for simplicity.

---

## No Self-Dealing

- Mandatory (Violation 2): Optimists must avoid conflicts of interest where possible and mitigate their impact when not possible. We recommend over-communicating and disclosing potential conflicts of interest even when they do not warrant abstaining from a vote.
    
    - 2a. Any actual or reasonably anticipated conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing and prominently displayed ahead of any voting (i.e. when submitting delegate commitments, when approving proposal drafts, when running for an elected position, when making public recommendations, etc.).
    - 2b. Any offer for external compensation relating to delegation or external compensation relating to the Optimism Protocol must be promptly disclosed.
    - 2c. Delegates are prohibited from approving and voting on their own proposals (this includes approval voting for Missions in which you are a team member or advisor). Delegates may not vote solely for their own candidacy in an election. In the case of approval/ranked choice elections, delegates may vote for themselves, so long as they also cast votes for the remaining elected positions.
        - _Example: I can vote for my own candidacy on the Growth Experiments committee, so long as I also cast 4 additional votes (a total of 5 votes, as there are 5 open positions on the sub-committee.)_
    - d. Badgeholders should not vote for organizations where they expect any portion of funds to flow to them or any projects from which they derive income.
- Mandatory (Violation 3): Badgeholders must not use private voting to obscure self-dealing.
    
    - After RetroPGF Rounds end, the Foundation or Code of Conduct Council may randomly sample 55 ballots to check for conflicts of interest.
    - If a suspected self-dealing violation is filed, the Foundation or the Code of Conduct Council may also review the ballot of the reported badgeholder to check for conflicts of interest.
    - Any Code of Conduct Council members that violate the privacy of randomly sampled or selectively revealed ballots are violating their responsibilities as Council members and are subject to Cllective Council and Advisory Board Member Removal, as outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]] (update coming soon!)

# Reporting

All Optimists are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. Any Optimist that is found to be in breach of this Code of Conduct will be subject to the below enforcement procedures.

- Type of violation:
    
    - **Standard:**
        
        - To report a Code of Conduct violation in the Token House, use this [reporting form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWdV673xKAUpu3PmeWapKW_PEnyVv0Bk8KLgD0Ysywol2geg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
        - To report a Code of Conduct violation in the Citizens’ House, use this [reporting form.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSda4Veekjl1DZxnv6RkbEP5nodEvJem7pxiug3qzuPqiGk_xQ/viewform?usp%3Dsf_link&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1695948577077517&usg=AOvVaw0VNUxzuHZR07P_-0RyjRsK)
    - **Grant misusage**:
        
        - To report a violation of the grant policies, use this [reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLySdMNyQ8aJdzOrMN3BfMy8fChsDuSQW6LLuIRuVm9gmavQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
    - For both types of violations, please cite the specific violation number (and letter, if applicable).
        
- The Code of Conduct Council will review the submissions. The identity of a submission author will not be publicly disclosed by the Code of Conduct Council without the author’s consent.
    
- Submission authors and/or the individual(s) or project(s) in question may be contacted by the Code of Conduct Council for additional information, if necessary.
    
- Please note: The Foundation will process Code of Conduct violations for the Citizens’ House before a Citizens’ House Code of Conduct Council is elected.

# Enforcement

There are a variety of possible enforcement actions, depending on the severity and type of the offense. The Token House will vote on grant misusage violations, grant clawbacks, and the removal of Collective Council and Advisory Board Members. The Code of Conduct Council will process all other violations, according to their [[Code of Conduct Councils|Council Charter]]. The Foundation will process Code of Conduct violations for the Citizens’ House before a Citizens’ House Code of Conduct Council is elected.  
Please note that ultimately Citizenship Criteria will be set via governance, at which point Citizens’ House Code of Conduct enforcement will be encoded in that criteria.

|Enforcement Type|Type of Violation|Enforcement|Consequence|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Standard Violations**||||
|Warning|First instance of inappropriate behavior|In Season 5, the NERDs, Code of Conduct Council, or Foundation may process and issue reported warnings.|A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may also be requested.|
|Temporary Suspension|A serious violation of the above standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.|In Season 5, the Code of Conduct Council will process and issue temporary Token House suspensions, subject to governance veto*.|In the Token House this equates to a temporary ban, lasting the length of 1 month, from Discord, Discourse, and Reddit. In the Citizens’ House, this also equates to the removal of a voting badge for the remainder of the current or next nearest Round. No related public or private interaction with the community members involved is allowed, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. Violating these terms may lead to longer term suspension.|
|Suspension|Repeated violation of the above standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, or severe violation.|In Season 5, the Code of Conduct Council will process and issue Token House suspensions, subject to governance veto*.|In the Token House, this equates to delegate suspension from Discord and Discourse and any sort of interaction within the community for a period of three months. In the Citizens’ House, this also equates to permanent loss of badge (please note that this badgeholder may re-qualify to be a Citizen in the future based on Citizenship Criteria.) OP Chains receiving delegation via the Chain Delegation Program will lose the corresponding delegation for the remainder of the program. Optimists may still participate in a RetroPGF round based on contributions made before the violation, provided they are not subject to a Future Grant Freeze.|
|**Grant Misusage Violation**||||
|Future Grant Freeze|Grant Recipients that have misused grant funding, as supported by factual evidence and/or on-chain data.|Token House must vote to temporarily freeze future grant funding via the Code of Conduct Violation proposal type outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]]. |If a vote for suspension is approved by the Token House, the grant recipient will be ineligible to receive grant funding from either the Token House or Citizens’ House (including retroactive public goods funding) for a period of one year. This applies to affiliates, with shared multi-sig signers as well.|

Please note there is a separate grant clawback proposal type, outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]], that addresses a grant recipient’s failure to execute on locked grants that have not yet been distributed.

*Code of Conduct Council decisions are optimistically approved by the Council’s corresponding House.That means the Council’s decisions will be assumed to have passed unless the Token House explicitly vetoes them. If >12% of the votable supply vetoes a Token House enforcement action, enforcement will go to a Token House vote in the next nearest Voting Cycle. If > 12% badgeholders veto a Citizens’ House enforcement action, enforcement will go to a Citizens’ House vote in the next nearest Voting Cycle.

## Change Process

The Code of Conduct, the Rules of Engagement, and any other associated documents, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for delegates.
