Please carefully read and understand the following Rules of Engagement for the Optimism Collective. These rules are for all Optimism community spaces, like the Governance forum (Discourse), Discord & Reddit. By engaging in the Optimism Discourse, Discord & Reddit, you agree to abide by these Rules of Engagement.

[[The Optimistic Vision|The Optimism Collective is an attempt to radically change how we can work together to create a powerful and sustainable digital ecosystem governed by and for its citizens]].

We expect that a base level of civility, respect, and understanding be maintained within community spaces. _**The Optimism Collective is a place for working together.**_ Everyone deserves to be treated with respect. [[Guidance on Severe Code of Conduct Violations|Harassment is not tolerated]].

---

1. _**Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, no exceptions.**_
    <br>
    - _**[[Guidance on Severe Code of Conduct Violations|Harassment and discrimination]] of any kind are not tolerated.**_
    
        Harassment is defined [[Guidance on Severe Code of Conduct Violations|here]]. Discrimination is defined as discriminating against any person based identifying features, such as religion, sexuality, ethnicity or geographical location. Actions reported in violation of this clause will result in suspension from community spaces, with additional consequences for delegates, badgeholders and grant recipients through the [[Code of Conduct]].
        <br>
    
     - _**Engage with others with patience, kindness and extreme civility.**_
    
        The Optimistic values are clear - we are all working towards making this the best space it can be. This requires extra patience and kindness.
    
        This is especially important when having hard conversations. Those are the times when kindness and understanding are needed the most. If you find yourself getting rude or snappy, go take a breather. We will still be here when you get back. ❤️
        <br>
2. _**Have a positive impact through adding value.**_
    <br>
    - _**Have meaningful engagement by only posting when you have something valuable to add.**_
    
        The Optimism community is huge, passionate and active. As such, posts and channels can get really busy. Posts and messages should meaningfully add to the conversation - or they may be removed.
    
        Meaningful contributions are defined as ideas & feedback (like how it could be made better, ways to make it more clear, etc.) and critiques. Critiques should have proof or evidence that the critique is based off of logic and or data.
    
        If you’d like to show support please use the reaction features available in community spaces (posting that you like an idea is not a meaningful contribution!).
        <br>


    - _**When making a claim, provide proof.**_
    
        If you make a claim of any kind you should always provide proof. Claims are an essential tool for Optimists to make informed decisions. Keep your claims to the evidence, make sure your argument is clear and has a high level of integrity. Claims that involve emotive or inflammatory language or make unsubstantiated claims will be removed, and may result in suspension from community platforms. For more details see the [[Guidance on Severe Code of Conduct Violations|definitions of harassment]].
        <br>
    
    - _**Use common sense.**_
    
        The Optimism community is so big and exciting that sometimes people get a bit carried away! We take pride in Optimism being a place of reasoned and sensible discussion, but everyone needs to help maintain this. Make sure you uphold the Optimism values!
        <br>
3. _**Stay Optimistic.**_
    <br>
    - _**We’re here to change the world, together.**_
    
        Through our ups and downs, it’s important to stay positive and continue to work collaboratively toward a better future.
        <br>
    
    - _**It takes a community to create a culture.**_
    
        It is up to each and every one of us to keep this space Optimistic. If you see any form of harassment or discrimination, report it _and_ call it out! Everyone deserves respect, and a simple message saying “it’s not OK to treat someone with anything less than kindness” may make a difference.
        <br>
    
    - _**Stay safe.**_
    
        There are a lot of target scams and phishing attempts in crypto. Keep your keys safe! Members of this forum will never ask you for a private key. Verify web addresses before interacting with dapps and do your own research. Seriously, a quick google can save you from a scam! Stay safe out there.
        

# Change Process

The Code of Conduct, the Rules of Engagement, and any other associated documents, must only be updated during Reflection Periods or following extraordinary circumstances that require immediate updates. In all cases, a change log will be published for delegates.

# Enforceability

If you do not abide by the rules above, you will receive a warning from the Foundation. After two warnings, you will receive a suspension for 1 month. After that, you will receive a 3 month suspension. If you continue not abiding by the above rules, you will be permanently removed from all Optimism community spaces. Any violation that rises to the level of those discussed in the Guidance on Severe Violations will result in a one month suspension right away.
