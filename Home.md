Welcome to the resource center for everything governance-related in the Optimism Collective. This centralized source of information replaces constant navigation between the various platforms (Forum, Community Hub, Charmverse, GitHub) where this information is now located.

The main objectives for this resource center are:

- Increasing governance accessibility by counteracting fragmentation of resources.
- Build a centralized source of information for governance of the Collective.
- Only highlight information that is relevant for the current Season, archiving everything else so that is still accessible.

> [!warning] Info
> At the moment, this Resource Center only provides individuals with a centralized source of necessary information for governance-related topics. It is however on the roadmap to expand this to cover technical elements too.

<br>
The Optimism Guide is a resource center for everything governance-related in the Optimism Collective. Our scope might expand in the future, but that is not decided yet.

The path to comprehending the requirements and adhering to the deadlines often required navigating a maze of forum posts. Understanding the nuances between the Foundation Missions (RFPs), Proposed Missions (Intent 1, 3 and 4), and Intent 2: which includes Builders Grants, Growth Grants, and RFGs, proved to be somewhat elusive at times.

Every category brought its unique set of procedures, rules, deadlines, and even communication platforms—spanning Github, Forum, Discord, Google Meets, and Charmverse. For individual developers or small teams, who may lack sufficient time or resources, this could be quite overwhelming.

At the moment, important information re: Optimism Collective is scattered around different pages:
- [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/)
- [Governance docs](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/)
- [Optimism Collective Mirror articles](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/)
- [Old Medium articles](https://medium.com/@optimismpbc)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism)
- [Charmverse](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208)
- [Notion](https://oplabs.notion.site/Optimism-RetroPGF-2-Badgeholder-Manual-11ef6cd63c254258a32246289f45925c)
- Google Sheets

This website brings all this information together in one dedicated place, with an interactive graph which shows all the connection between different things (similar to how your brain connects things by building neural links).

All content has an audio version for visually impaired and for those who can grasp content better when read out loud.

All content is more or less synced, and takes edits of the documents into account routinely.

# Guide

Some of the principles we've followed when deciding on a structure for this page: 

- **Ensuring the website is regularly updated to reflect the most recent information and developments.**
    
    - Content should always be relevant to the current Season we're finding ourselves in (currently this would be Season 4), and if something is no longer relevant it should still be preserved, but will be moved to Token House Governance > Token House History > ...
         
        - Some content relevant to the current Season is also visible in Token House History, if they otherwise have no adequate place in our page structure
- **Consolidating official resources, not writing them ourselves**
    
    - We add notes to information that in our opinion is outdated, and also open pull requests directly to the source material (Community Hub, ...) to correct mistakes, but we're only consolidating resources and not re-writing anything
        
        - Projects that plan to become revenue-generating businesses.
        - Projects that believe they will be included in the next round of Optimism RetroPGF. Receipt of a RetroPGF grant is not guaranteed as RetroPGF grants are subject to badeholder voting on behalf of the Citizens’ House.
    - Approved Missions will be eligible to apply for investment from this pilot set of investors.
