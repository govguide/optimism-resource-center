# Season 4 Recap

Thank you to the incredible delegates that experimented with us in Season 4:

- [Delegate retro rewards 16](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-delegate-rewards-season-4/6878): _Retroactive rewards in recognition of the contributions of high impact delegates over the past Season_

[Season 4 2](https://gov.optimism.io/t/guide-to-season-4-as-a-collective/5886) introduced several foundational concepts that helped the Collective work towards important goals:

- **Intents:** _Begin to align the entire Collective in pursuit of common strategic goals_
- **Trust Tiers:** _Begin to create a connection between one’s impact and opportunity within the Collective_
- **Missions:** _Enable the Token House to support work aligned with Intents and reward outsized Mission impact via RetroPGF_
- **Alliances:** _Scale the number of non-core teams building the Collective (alliances are now simply called teams)_
- **Attestations:** _Introduce attestations, for Grants Council Members and Co-grantors, as the basis of reputation in the Collective_

Other important steps towards further decentralization included [Welcoming Base](https://gov.optimism.io/t/welcoming-base-to-optimism-governance/6689) to the Collective, introducing the [Law of Chains](https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-section-by-section-overview/6515), outlining the [Future of Optimism Governance](https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-future-of-optimism-governance/6471), and introducing 2 new proposal types: Treasury Appropriations (Foundation budget approval) and Inflation Adjustments.

As always, these structures are experimental and may change, dissolve, and/or evolve over time. The initial separation of structures between the Token House and Citizens’ House is subject to change as the Citizens’ House becomes progressively more established.
