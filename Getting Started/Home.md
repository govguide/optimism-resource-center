Resources related to the governance system of the Optimism Collective are currently dispersed across a range of locations such as the Community Hub,  the Optimism Governance Forum, the Mirror blog, the old Medium blog, GitHub, Charmverse and Notion.

This fragmentation negatively impacts the accessibility of Optimism governance and makes the system difficult to understand for all but a few high-context governance participants. To make it easier to navigate seamlessly across available resources, the Optimism Resource Center consolidates all resources from the various platforms into a single place.

**ðŸ‘‰ Due to the iterative nature of Optimism governance, many resources are regularly updated. To not miss any policy changes and additions, see the changelog [[Changelog|here]].**
