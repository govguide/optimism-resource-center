## Collective Trust Tiers

Collective Trust Tiers are the very first step towards establishing a connection between one’s positive impact in the ecosystem and access to different types of work, grants, and roles within the Collective. Over time, Trust Tiers will become more robust as they incorporate Attestations and impact scores derived from one’s activity in the ecosystem.

The first iteration of Collective Trust Tiers was run as an experiment in Season 4. The Trust Tiers have been updated for Season 5, based on delegate feedback. Both Tiers and their criteria are subject to change based on feedback. Over time, we expect Tiers to be based on Collectively agreed upon trust scores, calculated using Attestations.

**Initially, Trust Tiers will be used to:**

- Establish transparent standards for contribution and grant eligibility
- Help people understand the types of contributions (and, over time, Attestations) we think are important for establishing the basis of reputation in the Collective

**Please note that in Season 5 Trust Tiers will be applicable to both Delegate and Foundation Mission Requests (this includes all grants processed by the Grants Council.)**

### Accountability Adjustments

- If you or your team have been found to have violated the Code of Conduct since the start of the last Season, you must move down by one Tier
- If you or your team have had a grant clawed back or have been found to have misused your grant - as defined in the [[Code of Conduct]] - since the last Season, you must re-set to the Ember Tier
- You can reference team Tiers in the [public gov tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ul8iMTsOFUKUmqz6MK0zpgt8Ki8tFtoWKGlwXj-Op34/edit?usp=sharing) or in the [Foundation Mission Request repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP)
