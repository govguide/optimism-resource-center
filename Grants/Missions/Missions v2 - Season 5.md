# Missions v2

The Mission process has been restructured based on delegate feedback from Season 4. The below design addresses [[Governance Update 7|delegate feedback]], optimizing for strategic alignment, reduction in delegate workload, higher context decision making, and streamlined processes across the Collective. The new process for Season 5 is illustrated below.

# What’s a Mission?

To understand Missions, you first need to understand Intents. Intents are directional goals that allow the Collective to align on near term targets.

![[Untitled (1) (1).png]]

Missions are specific initiatives aimed at achieving one of the Intents. They are tightly scoped and can be accomplished start-to-finish in less than 12 months.

**Missions are specific initiatives to be executed by a team of contributors rather than ongoing services or vaguely scoped work performed by permanent working groups.**

> **Example Mission:**
> 
> “Request to Upgrade OP Mainnet to the Bedrock Release” **NOT** “Request to Fund developers for the next 3 months”

# What’s a Mission Request?

Mission Requests are pre-specified requests for Missions that work towards the Collective Intents. They resemble [Foundation Mission (RFP)](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP) from Season 4.

To continue to scale the number of teams building the Collective, there will be two types of Mission Requests in Season 5:

- Foundation Mission Requests, supported by the Partner Fund
- Delegate Mission Requests, supported by the Governance Fund

**SEASON 5 CHANGE:** In Season 5, the top 100 Delegates may create Mission Requests at the beginning of each Season. Each Mission Request must be aligned with one of the Intents. A Mission Request outlines an initiative to be executed but does not assign a team to execute it.

> **Example Mission Requests:**  
> Intent 4: Governance Accessibility  
> Mission Request #1: Create Governance v3 contract for the Collective  
> Mission Requet #2: Onboard 100 new delegates

# What’s a Mission Application?

Teams, formerly called Alliances, submit Mission Applications applying to execute a Mission Request.

**SEASON 5 CHANGE:** Mission Applications are similar to Mission Proposals from Season 4, but they are submitted under Mission Requests rather than under Intents. The Grants Council, rather than the full Token House, will review all Mission Applications to select which team(s) will execute each Mission Request.

> **Example Mission Application:**  
> Application 1: Agora submits application to Mission Request #1 (build governance v3 contract)  
> Application 2: Tally submits application to Mission Request #1 (build governance v3 contract)
