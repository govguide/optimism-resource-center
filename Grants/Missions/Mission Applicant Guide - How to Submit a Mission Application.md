[[Missions v2 - Season 5|What's a Mission Request?]]

## Who Can Apply to Mission Requests?

- Teams, formerly called Alliances, may apply to Mission Requests at their corresponding [[Collective Trust Tiers|Collective Trust Tier]].
- Each team must identify a Team Lead. See this [[Season 4 Alliance Guide|guide]] for more information on forming and operating teams.
- If a team is comprised of individual contributors at different Tiers, the team’s Tier should correspond to the tier of Team Lead.
- Teams may apply for multiple Mission Requests given their intentionally specific scope. Any team member’s affiliation with multiple Mission Requests should be made clear.
- A delegate may apply to execute their own Delegate Mission Request, provided they are not a member of the Grants Council.

**Please note: All grant recipients are subject to the Code of Conduct and must KYC with the Foundation to receive rewards (as with all grants).**

## How do I Apply for a Foundation Mission Request?

Foundation Mission Requests, supported by the Partner Fund, are created and selected by the Optimism Foundation on a rolling basis. You can see previous Foundation Mission Requests [here](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-optimism/projects/31/views/1).

- Make sure you understand the [Application requirements](https://www.notion.so/Mission-v2-reviewed-b164f34b485b4cfeafbec8e14ad3f75c?pvs=21) as well as the Collective’s [[Collective Grant Policies|grant policies]] before applying.
- Foundation Mission Requests can be found on the ecosystem contributions [github](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP). Foundation Mission Requests will be labeled as such (Season 4 Mission Requests may be labeled as “RFP”)
- A Mission Application template should be included on each Foundation Mission Request
- Submit your completed Mission Application as a comment on the relevant github issue by the specified submission date
- The Foundation will select a team by the specified selection date
- Selected teams should post monthly progress updates on the relevant github issue until the Mission has been completed

## How do I Apply for a Delegate Mission Request?

![[Untitled (4).png]]

Delegate Mission Requests, supported by the Governance Fund, are created at the beginning of the Season by the top 100 delegates. These Mission Applications are processed by the Grants Council, which will set submission and selection deadlines corresponding to regular Voting Cycles.

- Make sure you understand the [Application requirements](https://www.notion.so/Mission-v2-reviewed-b164f34b485b4cfeafbec8e14ad3f75c?pvs=21) as well as the Collective’s [[Collective Grant Policies|grant policies]] before applying.
- Delegate Mission Requests can be found on the ecosystems contribution github.
- Mission Applications for Delegate Mission Requests can be submitted beginning in Voting Cycle #19 (see [public governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t))
- A Mission Application template should be included on each Delegate Mission Request.

### Suggested Mission **Application Template**

_This template may be adjusted by the Grants Council, on a case-by-case basis_

    _The critical milestone should be a measure of whether you’ve made best efforts to execute what is outlined in this proposal or not. If you fail to achieve your pre-defined critical milestone, your grant may be clawed back, [[OPerating Manual|as outlined in the Operating Manual]]._

The Grants Council, possibly with the assistance of a [[Developer Advisory Board]], will announce the selected proposal by the specified selection date

Selected teams should post monthly progress updates on the relevant github issue until the Mission has been completed

## What about Access to Upfront Capital?

Most Mission grants are awarded in the form of locked OP tokens. **These tokens will be locked for a period of one year,** unless your Mission qualifies as a growth experiments grant. Please make sure you understand the Collective’s [[Collective Grant Policies|grant policies]] before applying. We understand these policies present some limitations and have created a Foundation Mission Request to establish an [Ecosystem Investment Network](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/110) that may provide upfront capital to exceptional Mission applications.

## How Do Missions Relate to RetroPGF?

The Mission grant amount should reflect the minimum amount required to execute the Mission. Additional rewards may be received via RetroPGF, based on the impact of the executed Mission. We have suggested a 50/50 split between Mission/RetroPGF rewards in Season 5 to incentivize quality execution. Over time, the proportion of baseline grant to retroactive rewards should shift towards RetroPGF until everything is supported by RetroPGF.
