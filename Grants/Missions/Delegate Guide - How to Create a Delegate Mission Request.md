[[Missions v2 - Season 5|What's a Mission Request?]]

## How Do I Create a Delegate Mission Request?

- **If you are a Top 100 Delegate:** You may create a Delegate Mission Request using the below template. You may reference Foundation Mission Requests as an [example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/109).


## Delegate **Mission Request Template**

**Delegate Mission Request Summary:** _Mission Requests should be tightly scoped and well-specified. You can see examples [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP). You should describe your Mission Request in 1-2 sentences here._

**S5 [[Collective Intents - Season 5|Intent]]:** _Please list the Intent your Request aligns with here_

**Proposing Delegate:** _Delegate name/pseudonym, linked to delegate profile_

**Proposal [[Collective Trust Tiers|Tier]]:** _Please specify the Tier required for Mission Applications under this Request (ie. applications must be submitted by teams at the Fledging Tier)_

**Baseline grant amount:** _This amount should reflect the minimum amount required to execute the Mission. Additional rewards may be received via RetroPGF, based on impact/outperformance. We recommend a 50/50 split between Mission/RetroPGF rewards in Season 5 to incentivize quality execution. Over time, the proportion of baseline grant to retroactive rewards should shift towards RetroPGF until everything is funded by RetroPGF._

**Should this Foundation Mission be fulfilled by one or multiple applicants:** _Select from: “One,” “Up to X” or “Multiple”_

**Submit by:** _To be_ s_et by Grants Council_

**Selection by:** _To be set by Grants Council_

**Start date:** _If applicable_

**Completion date:** _If applicable. Please note Missions must be completed within 12 months (i.e. marked as `done`)._

### Specification

**How will this Delegate Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?**

- _Please explain alignment with the relevant Intent_

**What is required to execute this Delegate Mission Request?**

- _Please list responsibilities and/or expected deliverables_

**How should the Token House measure progress towards this Mission?**

- _These measures should focus on progress towards completion. Including expected completion dates for each is recommended_
- _Please be as specific as possible in defining measures of progress so that Token House delegates can accurately track execution_

**How should badgeholders measure impact upon completion of this Mission?**

- _These measures should be focused on performance and may be used by badgeholders to assess your Misson’s impact in the next round of RetroPGF_
- _Please be as specific as possible in defining measures of impact so that Citizens’ House badgeholders can accurately measure the grant’s impact_

### **Application Instructions:**

_To be defined by the Grants Council in accordance with their internal operating procedures_


## How Are Delegate Mission Requests Approved?

- **Mission Requests will only be proposed and approved at the beginning of each Season.** You can think of this as the Collective’s bi-annual budgeting process; it only happens at the beginning of each Season. While this creates some limitations, this process is designed to prioritize work and incentivize execution, which are common challenges in many DAOs. **This process will not occur again until Season 6.**
- In the first Voting Cycle of Season 5 (Voting Cycle #17), the Top 100 delegates may create Mission Requests using the template provided above. These Missions Requests should be posted to the forum.
- As with all proposals, each Delegate Mission Requests will need 4 delegate approvals to move to a vote. **Missions Requests under [[Collective Intents - Season 5|Intent #1]] must get 1 of the 4 approvals from the [[Developer Advisory Board]], if approved.** If delegates do not believe a proposal works towards the specified Intent, they should not approve it. See [[Missions v2 - Season 5#Delegate Guide Voting Schedule|Delegate Guide: Voting Schedule]] for precise deadlines.

> [!info]- Improvements to the approval process relative to Season 4
 > - **More delegates with approval power:** The Top 100 delegates may provide approvals. This expands the number of delegates able to provide approval relative to Season 4, which was limited to delegates with > 0.25% voting power
 > - **Clear approval process:** The Top 100 delegates may opt-in to provide approvals for Mission Requests under a specific Intent. Mission Requests will then be evenly and randomly distributed among delegates which have opted-in to review Mission Requests under a given Intent.
 > - **Additional time:** There will be one full cycle dedicated to providing approvals and one full cycle dedicated to reviewing/voting on Mission Requests. The Grants Council will not process any grants during these cycles.
 > - **govNERDs:** [govNERDs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/109), if continued in Season 5, will be available to help shepard Mission Requests through the feedback, approval, and voting process

- Delegate Mission Requests are supported by Intent Budgets. The Token House will approval rank approved Delegate Mission Requests under each [[Collective Intents - Season 5|Intent]] until the associated budget is depleted. Only the top ranked Mission Requests that fit within the Intent Budget will be approved. If a Mission Request would push the Intent Budget over the approved amount, it will not be included. Any Intent Budgets left over will be returned to the Governance Fund. Intent Budgets are proposed by the Grants Council Lead and will be voted on in Special Voting Cycle ``#16b``.
    
    **SEASON 5 CHANGE:** This process will replace the approval ranking of individual Mission Proposals that occurred in Season 4. That means delegates will be asked to approval rank the Missions that should be executed but not decide which teams will execute them.
    
    > **Example:**  
    > Delegates are asked to determine whether the Collective needs a governance v3 contract rather than determine which team should build the governance v3 contract.
    
    You can see an example of approval voting under Intent Budgets [[How to Vote on Mission Proposals|here]]. See [[Missions v2 - Season 5#Delegate Guide Voting Schedule|Delegate Guide: Voting Schedule]] for more details on timing.
