## Season 4 Alliance Guide

An Alliance is a group of people (new or pre-existing) that will work together to complete a Mission. An Alliance can be a pre-established organization or a group of contributors that comes together specifically to complete a [Mission 57](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881/2).

### [](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-4-alliance-guide/5873#what-does-an-alliance-need-2)What Does an Alliance Need?

There are a few key features that all Alliances need to have:

- **A leader.** The [Trust Tier 39](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877) of the leader is the Trust Tier of the whole Alliance. See more about Trust Tiers here. The leader will also be the main communication point for governance to ask questions and get updates, and should be available for such.
    
- **A Mission.** The Mission can be a Foundation Mission (RFP) that the Alliance is applying for or a Mission the Alliance is proposing (Proposed Mission.)
    
- **Defensible value.** A good Alliance has a clear reason why they are the best suited to execute its Mission. Is it your skill combination? Unique contextual understanding? Relevant experience?
    
    - If applying for a Foundation Mission (RFP), an Alliance should also be able to defend why their skillset/context/experience/positioning is the best suited to complete the Mission.
        
    - If proposing a Mission, an Alliance should also be able to defend its Proposed Mission’s potential impact on the Collective.

A good Alliance has the following:

- **Reward distribution plan:** A clear idea or plan for distributing the Mission funding to the Alliance members.
    
- **Conflict resolution plan:** An internal conflict resolution process. The DAO will not handle internal Alliance disputes unless they directly relate to defrauding the DAO.
    
    - Here are some helpful questions to have thought about:
        
        - What do we do if someone has worked significantly less than everyone else?
        - What if someone gets sick and cannot contribute at no fault of their own?
        - What do we do if someone wants to leave the Alliance?
        - Are you following the leader strictly (dictatorship) or allowing everyone to have an equal say? (democracy). Both are valid options!
- **Communication:** Have a dedicated space for communication (like Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc.). If creating an Alliance from scratch, check for timezone compatibility or sufficient overlap.
