**Council Charter**:

· Link to original Charter: [Season 3 Charter](https://gov.optimism.io/t/special-voting-cycle-9a-grants-council/4198)

· Link to Last Season’s Charter: [Season 4 Charter](https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-grants-council-season-4-charter/5924)

· Link to [[(DRAFT) Proposed Grants Council Charter - Season 5|proposed Season 5 Charter]] - Please note all Council Charters will now be maintained on github as pages under the [Operating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/tree/main)

Please note that the Charter of the Council will need to be expanded to account for the following changes in Scope:

§ The Grants Council will now process all Delegate Mission Applications, under all Intents (not just Intent #2)

§ The Grants Council will no longer operate its own Request For Grant program, but rather will be able to propose Delegate Mission Requests, subject to Token House approval in Voting Cycle #18

§ Mission Applications will continue to be classified as growth experiments or builders grants, or a combination of the two. The Grants Council should continue to evaluate these grants based on defined goals and public rubrics for each grant type, as well as their ability to achieve the corresponding Intent

§ All Mission Applications should be processed according to Trust Tiers

**Breakdown of Council Operating Budget**:

The proposed Council Operating Budget is increased relative to Season 4 for a number of reasons. First, the number of reviewers has increased by five in order to accommodate much larger than anticipated interest (in the prior Season) in the Optimism Grants Program. The reviewers span three Sub-Committees rather than two in Seasons 3 + 4. Second, the Grants Council was dedicated to one intent in Season 4, but will review proposals from all intents for Season 5. Third, the Season 4 budget was put together with ten weeks of grant processing in mind (in reference to Season 3, which was two cycles), relative to 12 weeks of grant processing in Season 5.

**3 Sub-Committees and Ops = 400k OP**

- _Builders_: 5 Reviewers @ 30k OP (+ 5k OP from S4)
- _Experiments_: 5 Reviewers @ 30k OP (+5k OP from S4)
- _Milestones and Metrics_: 3 Reviewers @ 25k OP (new in S4)
- Ops Manager: Additional 10k OP (+5k from S4)*
- _Milestones and Metrics Manager_: Additional 10k OP (new in S4)
- _Communications Manager_: Additional 5k OP (same as S4)

*_Should he be re-elected as a reviewer, the intention would be to reappoint [@Gonna.eth](https://gov.optimism.io/u/gonna.eth) to this position._

**Council-related requests for grants = 40k OP**

- 40k OP will be set aside for grants specifically designed to enhance Council operations (e.g., knowledge management platform, front-end, developer contributions, etc).

**Lead = 0 OP**

- This position will be rewarded only through retroPGF if it is rewarded for Season 5.

_This budget does not include: any amounts granted by the Foundation for ongoing milestone review and council maintenance prior to Season 5 launch or any amounts granted to Council-members for prior seasons for RetroPGF._

- Review > 95% of Mission Requests

· _Benchmark Milestone 2_

· _Benchmark Milestone 3_

- NPS score from finalists > 7/10

_· KPI 2_

- Creation of Milestone Hub for long-term milestone tracking

_· KPI 3_
