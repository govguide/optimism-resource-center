# Collective Grant Policies

These grant policies apply to all Governance Fund grants. Failure to abide with the below policies may result in the refusal to distribute subsequent milestone based distributions and/or the clawback of a locked grant.

In the event that an applicant misuses their grant in a way that does not constitute a violation of these policies, a report should be filed via the [Grant Misuse Reports category](https://gov.optimism.io/t/about-the-grant-misuse-reports-category/7578) and their grant will be uploaded to a public database.

Note that these grant policies do not apply to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) grants.

### Disclosures

(Violation 1a)

Grants-as-a-service arrangements, while not prohibited, must be disclosed prominently in any proposals utilizing such services. These services include arrangements to help teams write, review, or otherwise submit proposals in exchange for a portion of any grant funding received.

Grant recipients should abide by the Governance Fund [[Public Reporting Requirements for Grantees|public reporting requirements]], if applicable.

### No Sale Policy for Growth Experiments

(Violation 1b)

**OP received through Growth Experiments Grants, or any grants made to distribute OP direclty on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient.** This “no sale” rule:

- _Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates and any other related persons._ These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.
- _Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly or privately._ Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.
- _Includes any other transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below._
- _Does not include using OP to incentivize usage_. Providing OP as liquidity mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.
- _There is no expiration to this rule for Growth Experiments Grants._
- _Grant recipients must be able to accept OP and/or use OP to execute their proposal._

### Lock-Up

(Violation 1c)

**OP received through Builders Grants, including Missions that do not pass OP directly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient for a period of one year.** The prohibition against selling includes any transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below. After a holding period of one year, Builders Grant recipients have full discretion over how they utilize OP, so long as it coincides with the objectives outlined in their proposal.

### Effective Sale

(Violation 1d)

An effective sale includes selling, offering to sell, contracting or agreeing to sell, hypothecate, pledge, use as collateral, or creating derivatives of the OP tokens. It also includes entering into any arrangement that transfers to another person or entity, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of owning the OP tokens.

You can read more about the reasoning behind the token locks [[Grant Token Lock Explainer|here]].

### Self-Delegation of Grants

(Violation 1e)

Grant recipients must not self-delegate growth experiments grants for use in governance. Builders grants may be self-delegated during and/or after the one-year lock-up period. Delegations may be made or changed at the time a grant is received or at the start of a Season.

### Changes to Proposals

(Violation 1f)

Grant recipients must execute the grant in accordance with what is outlined in the approved grant proposal. Grant recipients that wish to change the use of the grant from what is outlined in the proposal must submit a new proposal requesting approval for the change. To do so, they must follow the grants process in place at the time. If the change is not approved, the recipient must execute the grant as outlined in the original proposal or return the portion of grant funding affected by the unapproved change.

Grant recipients must distribute growth experiment or other user incentive grants within six months of the grant being made unless they give public notice to the community explaining any delay or request an extension approved by the Grants Council.

### Critical Milestones and Clawback

Critical milestones demonstrate good faith effort to accomplish the aims set forth in a proposal.

Critical milestones are meant to provide the Optimism community with satisfaction that the proposer has taken actions consistent with those outlined in an approved proposal.

Non-completion of critical milestones will be grounds for clawback of any remaining locked tokens, as outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]].

On-chain data or other publicly verifiable information is favored for the determination of critical milestones.

An example of a critical milestone is: “We will deploy X smart contract on Y date.”
