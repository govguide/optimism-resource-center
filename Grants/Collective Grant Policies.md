### No Sale Policy for Growth Experiments

**OP received through Growth Experiments Grants, or any grants made to distribute OP directly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient.** This “no sale” rule:

- _Includes the grant recipient, their affiliates and any other related persons._ These persons cannot receive OP for the purpose of selling (or if the grant recipient knows they intend to sell) the tokens.
- _Includes the direct exchange of OP for crypto or fiat, whether done publicly or privately._ Think selling OP in exchange for fiat or crypto, regardless of whether done on a CEX, DEX, OTC desk, at your local park, or otherwise.
- _Includes any other transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below._
- _Does not include using OP to incentivize usage_. Providing OP as liquidity mining incentives is not restricted by these parameters.
- _There is no expiration to this rule for Growth Experiments Grants_

### Lock-Up

**OP received through Builders Grants, including Missions that do not pass OP directly on to end users, should not be sold by the grant recipient for a period of one year.** The prohibition against selling includes any transaction that is an “effective sale,” as defined below. After a holding period of one year, Builders Grant recipients have full discretion over how they utilize OP, so long as it coincides with the objectives outlined in their proposal.

### Effective Sale

An effective sale includes selling, offering to sell, contracting or agreeing to sell, hypothecate, pledge, use as collateral, or creating derivatives of the OP tokens. It also includes entering into any arrangement that transfers to another person or entity, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of owning the OP tokens.

### No Self-Delegation of Grants

**Token grants must not be self-delegated for use in governance.** The primary purpose of these token grants is to incentivize sustainable usage and growth of the Optimism ecosystem. Accordingly, for partners interested in increasing their voting power, the preferred route is by encouraging users to delegate their rewards to your governance representatives.

### Critical Milestones and Clawback

Critical milestones demonstrate good faith effort to accomplish the aims set forth in a proposal.

Critical milestones are meant to provide the Optimism community with satisfaction that the proposer has taken actions consistent with those outlined in an approved proposal.

Non-completion of critical milestones will be grounds for clawback of any remaining locked tokens, as outlined in the [[OPerating Manual]].

On-chain data or other publicly verifiable information is favored for the determination of critical milestones.

An example of a critical milestone is: “We will deploy X smart contract on Y date.”

---

Violation of these policies are violations of the [[Code of Conduct]]. Given the importance of these policies, the Optimism Foundation can also enforce them and claw back any grants found to be in violation.

Note that these grant policies do not apply to Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) grants.
