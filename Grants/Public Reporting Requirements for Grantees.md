Delegates have begun taking steps towards providing this oversight in the # gov-monitoring channel and on the [Forum](https://gov.optimism.io/t/op-grants-through-season-2-where-has-the-op-gone/4025). The Foundation would like to support these efforts by suggesting standardized reporting requirements for grant recipients.

Those submitting proposals would be responsible for providing the below data in an easy to input format. This data would be publicly accessible and usable by the community. This process is easily adaptable, so it can be managed by the Grants Council, if the Council passes in S3, or any alternative structure that prevails if the Council does not pass.

Grant recipients would need to agree to these reporting requirements in the grant application template (which would be updated to reflect this). There are two obvious opportunities to collect this data from grant recipients: when the Foundation collects KYC info at time of grant approval and when milestone-based grant distributions are evaluated. On an ongoing basis, proposers are incentivized to provide updates as delegates may actively monitor this data, which will be accessible via a public dashboard.

We’d like to get delegate feedback on the below suggested reporting requirements. The goal is to create a set of reporting requirements that results in consistently structured and easy to ingest disclosures without creating a level of friction that deters projects from building on Optimism.

### **Proposed Reporting Fields**

Our goal is to collect all information in a way that:

- Any delegate/analyst can accurately track grant distributions
- Governance can effectively evaluate growth experiments and continue to iterate
- Requirements are thorough but lightweight enough to avoid overburdening proposers

_The following information may be entered by proposers in a Google Form. Results would be publicly viewable by anyone (and updatable by the Foundation or Grants Council, as applicable)_

## **For Growth Experiment Grants**

**OP Incentive Distribution Schedule:** Up-to-date schedule of OP planned, in-flight, and completed OP incentives. There should be one entry for each distinct distribution strategy (i.e. Row 1: retroactive airdrop, Row 2: liquidity mining on Pool A, Row 3: liquidity mining on Pool B).

1. **Project Name:** Name of project giving out OP
2. **Affiliated Project (if applicable):** Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales <> Overtime, Gamma/Arrakis/xToken <> Uniswap)
3. **Distributor contract address:** What address(es) are tokens distributed from?
4. **Announcement Date:** Date a program was announced
5. **Announcement Link:** Link to program announcement and details
6. **Start Date:** Date a program started
7. **End Date:** Date a program ended
8. **Distribution Type:** i.e. Liquidity mining, Trading mining, Competition, Retroactive airdrop, Other (explain)
9. **OP per Epoch:** If a scheduled program, how much OP goes out per epoch (i.e. 500 OP)
10. **Epoch Length:** If a scheduled program, how long is the epoch (i.e. 1 week = 500 per week)
11. **App Incentivized:** Is usage incentivized on the native app, an external liquidity pool (i.e. DEX pool), something else?
12. **Contract(s) Incentivized:** What address(es) are incentivized (i.e. DEX Router, LP Pool)
13. **Action(s), Pool(s), etc. Incentivized:** What type of action is incentivized (i.e. NFT Purchases, stETH/ETH pool liquidity)
14. **Eligible Addresses:** Is this limited to a specific address list? If so, how many (i.e. retro airdrop) and/or what is the eligibility requirement (i.e. holders of a specific NFT)?
15. **Extra Notes:** Any other information that helps us accurately understand token distribution - Or an explanation if the program’s structure does not fit this structure

**OP Internal Transfer Record:** List of internal transfers of a project’s OP token grant (i.e. transferring tokens between wallets). This will provide visibility into which tokens have left the project’s provided L2 address, but are not yet distributed.

1. **Project Name:** Name of project giving out OP
2. **Affiliated Project (if applicable):** Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales for Overtime)
3. **Transaction Hash:** Transaction hash of the transfer
4. **Sender Address:** Address sending the OP (i.e. the project’s wallet)
5. **Recipient Address:** Address receiving the OP (i.e. the project’s wallet)
6. **Recipient Address Name:** What is the recipient address’ purpose (i.e. entity name, address label)

## **For Builders Grants**

**Grant Program Distributions:** List of grant payouts for projects who used their OP governance grant to run their own grants program. This helps us understand the impact of governance distributions to project grants programs (i.e. what super cool things came out of the grants programs?)

1. **Project and Grant Name:** Name of grant and project transferring OP
2. **Affiliated Project (if applicable):** Top-Level project that received OP (i.e. Thales for Overtime)
3. **Transaction Hash:** Transaction hash of the transfer
4. **Sender Address:** Address sending the OP (i.e. the project’s wallet)
5. **Recipient Address:** Address receiving the OP (i.e. the project’s wallet)
6. **OP Transferred:** Amount of OP Tokens Transferred
7. **Recipient Address Name:** What is the recipient address’ purpose (i.e. entity name, address label)
8. **Grantee Name:** Name of the entity receiving the grant (could be generic, i.e. bug bounty, if relevant)
9. **Grantee Website/Github/Twitter:** Where can we keep up with the grantee’s progress?
10. **Grant Description:** Information about the grant (i.e. purpose, milestones, grant program information)
