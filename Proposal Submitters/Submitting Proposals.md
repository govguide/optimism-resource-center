## Governance Fund Grant Proposals

You can apply for grant funding from the Governance Fund by submitting an [[Mission Applicant Guide - How to Submit a Mission Application|Application]] to a Mission Request which will be evaluated by the Optimism Grants Council or Foundation.

## Non-Grant Proposal Types

There are [[OPerating Manual#**Valid Proposal Types**|other types of proposals]] that you can submit.

There is no minimum holding requirement for submitting a proposal but all non-grant proposals must be approved by four delegates with sufficient voting power to move to a vote (as defined in the [[OPerating Manual#**Valid Proposal Types**|OPerating Manual]]).

The process for submitting non-grant proposals is outlined in the [[OPerating Manual#**Valid Proposal Types**|OPerating Manual]].
